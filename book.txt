EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK 



Your insider's guide 
to the new REDBOOK 

H 



ave you ever arrived 

home after making what 
. you think is a major 
beauty change— check out my 
lowlights!— only to have your 
husband look straight at you, 
open a beer, and notice nothing? 
In this way, husbands and 
magazine readers can be similar. 
(Bear with me.) We editors think 
we've rocked our pages with some 
momentous transformation, but 
readers often take a look and 
shrug. Well, this month we went 
way beyond lowlights. The 
REDBOOK you have in your 
hands is completely made over, 
cover to cover. We've dreamed up 
new sections and columns, and added more beauty, fashion, health, 
fun celebrities, interesting real women, and a whole mini-magazine 
devoted to food starting on page 2'25. Finally, we've packaged it all in a 
fresh, modern design lit up by fabulous photography. 

You played a big role in this process, sending us your story ideas and 
strong opinions, which is why we invented Spill, Vent, Gossip, Go! 
(page 29). It's a section designed to capture readers' voices, buzzing this 
month about everything from teen tattoos to cheater comebacks. (To 
get counted in next month's polls— and even quoted in the magazine- 
go to redbookmag.com orfacebook.com/redbook.) So really, you're 
already insiders when it comes to the new REDBOOK, but these notes 
will tell you even more. Thanks for your help, ladies, and keep letting us 
know what you want REDBOOK to do for you. We're listening!

THE PAIR ON PAGE 214 LOOK IN 
LOVE-BECAUSE THEY ARE! 

For this story we wanted a picture that felt sexy, 
sweet, and not pose-y. You can't get that with models, 
says photographer Stephanie Rausser (left), so she 
shot an actual couple. "It was great," she laughs. 
"They could hardly keep their hands off each other."

EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK- 



INSIDER SECRET #3 

There are tricks 
for great kid pics. 

PHOTOGRAPHER MATT 
HRANEK CAPTURES MAXIMUM 
CUTENESSONPAGE196. 
THESE ARE HIS GREAT TIPS. 

Instead of trying to pose 
kids doing something you think 
is adorable, capture them in 
the middle of something they 
actually enjoy. Great shots will 
come naturally. 

Take one step in 
from where you would 
normally stand. 
Being closer elicits 
a more emotional 
response. 

Tell them to say 
"boogers" instead 
of "cheese." It gets 
a laugh every time! 





INSIDER SECRET #4 

Guys are softies. 

The priceless love letters on 
page 214 prove that, but I was 
also floored by what actor/ 
entrepreneur Andrew Shue 
said when we asked what 
inspired him to create the 
online community CafeMom: 
"My mother was a single, 
working mom of four. She 
struggled, and she was 
isolated. Many moms want to 
share their experiences, so the 
idea of a website to connect 
them came naturally." 




INSIDER SECRET #5 

IT'S MENU 

MADNESS OUT THERE. 
Kids eat double the calories at 
restaurants than they would at a 
home-cooked meal, according to 
studies. So every month we're giving 
you a healthier-at-home version of 
a restaurant fave. The quesadilla on 
page 250 saves you 1,359 calories 
and 103 grams of fat. Wow.

That's what a

(It's because they

less fat.) Do arm 
exercises like the 
ones this model 
demonstrates on

times a week and 
you'll begin to see 
results in three to

Job: President of an online marketing business 

Family: Married 1 1 years; father to Jade, 4, and Max, 1 

His wife, Jill, loves to tell their engagement story: After dating for 
1 1 months, Paul got down on one knee in front of her... and a crowd of 3,000 
people. "I was a dancer for the basketball team in town, and Paul arranged to 
propose during halftime," she says. But Paul's not all about grand gestures, 
she continues: "Every evening when he gets home from work, he'll take our 
daughter, Jade, to the park to get Popsicles for dessert. It's really cute!"

"As a first-time mom who is expecting a child through 
adoption, I was thrilled to read Sheryl Crow's story!" 



RED 

Whatno 
one ewer 

tells you 
about 
marriage 




OH, BABY! 

Thank you for your adoption-friendly 
August issue. As a first-time mom 
expecting a child through adoption, 
I was thrilled to read the interview 
with Sheryl Crow and the unbelievable 
story of the Kamnik family ["Three 
Babies in One Year?"]. After a year of 
unsuccessful fertility treatments, and 
some of the saddest months of my life, 
our adoption experience has been 
one of hope, joy, and anticipation. 
I'm so glad those very feelings were 
portrayed to your readers. 

ANNA SULLIVAN, St. Paul, MN 

I found the article "Three Babies in 
One Year?" very relatable. I struggled 
through my pregnancies (two mis- 
carriages, one ectopic pregnancy, and 
one stillbirth at 5 months). After my 
last miscarriage, I gave up hope that I 
could carry a baby to term and adopted 
When my daughter was \6 months 
old, I discovered I was pregnant by no 
means of medicine— something my 
doctor thought couldn't happen. Now, 
I have two beautiful daughters who are 
exactly 1 year and 360 days apart. 
R.K., Brooklyn. NY 



GOOD ADVICE? 

I was dismayed at Karen Karbo's 
response to the woman whose husband 
had suffered a severe head injury [The 
Heart Stuff, August]. Raising the 
possibility of an extramarital affair to 
satisfy her sexual needs was terrible 
advice. I have a friend who was in a 
similar situation. His wife was sick. He 
went outside the marriage to get his 
needs met, and even now, years after 
his wife passed away, he regrets what 
he did. Marriage vows are taken for 
better and for worse; it's up to us to face 
our situations with integrity and honor.

As the mom of a 6-year-old, I appre- 
ciated Alice Bradley's essay ["Is My Son 
Trying to Make Me Nuts?" August]. 
I've been rolling with the moods, and it 
is difficult. Knowing I am not alone in 
this phase of motherhood is priceless.

"Look, if babies get loud or disruptive,

honest: If a new mom isn't welcome with 
her child in public spaces, she might 
never get out of the house and socialize

Having children in that setting changes 
the dynamic. I want to think about

SYMBICORT is for asthma that is not well controlled on a long-term asthma medicine, or when disease severity warrants 



s 

I 



- 



s 



/? 



My asthma... under control with the help of SYMBICORT. 






When my symptoms came back, my doctor and I chose SYMBICORT to help improve my lung function. 

SYMBICORT helps me breathe better all day, starting within 15 minutes * It won't replace a rescue inhaler 
for sudden symptoms. Unlike most other asthma medicines, SYMBICORT combines two medicines to 
help control inflammation and constriction. • Your results may vary 

Ask your doctor if SYMBICORT is a good choice for you. 





IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SYMBICORT 



Important Safety Information About SYMBICORT for Asthma 
SYMBICORT contains formoterol, a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic 
agonist (LABA). LABA medicines such as formoterol increase the risk of 
death from asthma problems. It is not known whether budesonide, the 
other medicine in SYMBICORT, reduces the risk of death from asthma 
problems seen with formoterol. 

SYMBICORT should be used only if your healthcare provider decides 
that your asthma is not well controlled with a long-term asthma control 
medicine, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or that your asthma is severe 
enough to begin treatment with SYMBICORT. 

If you are taking SYMBICORT. see your healthcare provider if your asthma does 
not improve or gets worse. It is important that your healthcare provider assess 
your asthma control on a regular basis. Your doctor will decide if it is possible 
for you to stop taking SYMBICORT and start taking a long-term asthma control 
medicine without loss of asthma control. 

SYMBICORT does not replace rescue inhalers for sudden asthma symptoms. 
Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all your health conditions, 
including heart conditions or high blood pressure, and all medicines you may 
be taking. Some patients taking SYMBICORT may experience increased blood 
pressure, heart rate, or change in heart rhythm. 

Do not use SYMBICORT more often than prescribed. While taking SYMBICORT, 
never use another medicine containing a LABA for any reason. Ask your 
healthcare provider or pharmacist if any of your other medicines are LABA 
medicines, as using too much LABA may cause chest pain, increase in blood 
pressure, fast and irregular heartbeat headache, tremor, and nervousness. 







Patients taking SYMBICORT 

• may experience serious allergic reactions including rash, hives, swelling 
of the face, mouth and tongue, and breathing problems. 

• may have a higher chance of infection. Tell your healthcare provider 
immediately if you think you are exposed to infections such as chicken 
pox or measles, or if you have any signs of infection. 

• may experience an increase in wheezing right after taking SYMBICORT, 
eye problems including glaucoma and cataracts, decreases in bone mineral 
density, swelling of blood vessels, decrease in blood potassium and increase 
in blood sugar levels. 

If you are switching to SYMBICORT from an oral corticosteroid, follow your 

healthcare provider's instructions to avoid serious health risks when you stop 

using oral corticosteroids. 

Children and adolescents who take LABA medicines may have an increased 

risk of being hospitalized for asthma problems.

SERIOUSLY 
FOOLPROOF FAKES 

False lashes are in every Hollywood 
bombshell's kit, for good reason: They make 
eyes look that much more alluring. And 
you— yes, you— can apply them easily with 
our no-fail, stress-free guide. 

I . Stick to individual lashes rather than 
full strips. "They look more natural," says 
Rebecca Restrepo, the makeup artist who 
gets lashes just right for CoverGirl ads. 
(TryArdell DuraLash Naturals Individual 
Lashes, $4. The pros all love the same glue: 
Duo Adhesive, $8, which dries clear.) 

'Z. Apply a dot of glue on the base of the false 
lash. "Let it dry for about a minute before 
sticking it on," Restrepo says. This makes the 
glue tacky and gives you more control. 

'3. Starting from the outside corner and 
working your way in, glue falsies to the base 
of your lashes, not your skin. Just cover about 
the outer quarter of your lash line. Finish 
with two coats of mascara— and you're set! 




Kim Kardashian would be 
the first to tell you: Lashes 
like these are fake! 



PRO TIPS THAT HAVE MAJOR IMPACT 




£ 



COAT THE TOP SIDE OF 
CASHES 

"Not applying mascara to the 
top side of your lashes is like 
not applying lipstick to your 
top lip," Restrepo says. So 
before applying mascara to the 
underside, be sure to sweep 
the wand over the top side. 



USE YOUR 
BUSINESS CARD 

Makeup artist Jake Bailey (who's 
worked with Angelina Jolie) says 
to place a card against your eyelid 
and behind your lashes when 
applying mascara, so you can 
really saturate each lash— without 
getting it all over your lids. 



LOAD IT ON 
YOUR LASH LINE 

For a really lush look, New York 
City makeup artist Emir says to 
use the tip of the wand to dab 
mascara along the lash roots, 
almost like you're poking yourself 
in the eye. Then work from the 
roots all the way up to the tips. 



CAN YOU REALLY GROW MORE LASHES? 

Suddenly, there are a bajillion products claiming to do just that. We tried three. 



There's been big buzz about Latisse, the 
prescription-only (and, at S125, pricey) drug 
that makes lashes longer over time. But 
can you get results from over-the-counter 
products? After three weeks of testing, 
here's what we found: • FusionBeauty 



StimuLash Fusion Intensive Night Condi- 
tioning Lash Enhancer, $89, "made me stop 
losing lashes, something I was noticing every 
time I took my makeup off," says our photo 
editor. Rosaliz Jimenez. • Rimmel London 
Lash Accelerator Mascara, $10, "helped my 



crooked lashes fan out evenly, but I haven't 
seen any growth," reports associate fashion 
editor Cristina Desposito. • Talika Lipocils 
Expert, S55, "made my stubby inner-eye 
lashes as long as the rest!" says beauty director 
Cheryl Kramer Kaye. — KRISTA BENNETT DEMAIO

GOT A TRICKY HAIR ISSUE? AN ICKY SKIN PROBLEM? TELL IT TO OUR 
BEAUTY DIRECTOR, CHERYL KRAMER KAYE. EVERYONE ELSE DOES! 

1 ll ftOflTSt.... I have little red spider veins around my nose and they drive me crazy— it 
means I can never go without concealer. They're a result of inflammation and sun damage 
(what isn't?), and they're genetic (thanks, Grandpa!). I've been tempted to have them zapped 
with a laser, but then Bremenn Research Labs sent me a new product claiming to reduce the 
appearance of facial spider veins. It promised results in a mere two weeks. I had my doubts 
because it features one of those made-up-sounding complexes: Venilex. But Venilex, it turns 
out, contains a cocktail of anti-inflammatory heavy-hitters that have a proven track record. Two weeks in, I 
pulled out the magnifying mirror, and sure enough, my veins do look lighter. I'll save the laser for later.

I tend to fall asleep with my makeup 
on. How bad is that?" -h.u., 47 

If you're the kind of woman who can fall asleep with makeup 
on and still wake up with clear skin, more power to you. I'm 
not so lucky, so at a minimum, I clean my face with a wet 
wipe made expressly for people with our type of lazy streak. 
(I like the Evening Soothe towelettes from Pond's. S5.) You 
just have to remember to leave them on the night table. 

I always get a zit in the same 
spot on my chin. Ugh! And why?" 

-LP., 27 

A lot of people get a regularly appearing "phone zit"— from 
where the not-so-clean receiver rubs against your chin. If that 
might be you, wipe down your phone's mouthpiece with 
an alcohol pad every day or two. And if the pimple is on 
your non-phone side? I asked dermatologist Amy Wechsler, 
M.D., who said the pore is probably damaged, so there's 
some level of inflammation that never really goes away. 
Alas, at-home remedies just won't do it. A dermatologist can 
inject the pimple with triamcinolone, which will shrink it right 
down; after that you might never see the pimple again, but 
sometimes it takes a few doctor visits to get rid of it for good. 



I'm pregnant, and 
suddenly I've got hair 
on my belly. What can 

I do?" -K.D., 30 

We are grateful, oh hormones, for the many gifts you 
give us during pregnancy, including a fuzzy tummy. 
I'd stay away from depilatories: too stinky for your 
sensitive nose and unnecessarily chemical -heavy. 
And waxing will hurt like a beast on your sensitive 
belly skin. But there's absolutely no reason not to 
shave your stomach— ideally when your husband 
isn't watching. No, the hair won't grow back darker 
or thicker, and yes, this problem will disappear about 
six months after you deliver.

The rough, piece-y texture of Katie's hair 
in the movie was inspired by the actress's 
own half-grown-out layers. "I added clip- 
in hair extensions to give her even more 
choppiness," says Adkins Mvondo. Try 
it: Clip a few hair pieces (such as Hairdo 
Salon Clip-in Extensions from Jessica 
Simpson and Ken Paves) under your hair; 
they'll blend in and add cool layering.

3 secrets 

to Katie's 
new 
movie look 

In Katie Holmes's new 
movie The Romantics, 
her character, Laura, is 
caught in a particularly 
pointy love triangle: 
She's about to watch her 
ex and her best friend 
get married. Somehow, 
despite the heartbreak, 
she manages to look 
effortlessly gorgeous. 
(It's Hollywood heart- 
break.) We pinned 
down the movie's pros- 
Marilyn Carbone, 
makeup department 
head, and Whitney 
Adkins Mvondo, key 
hairstylist— to see how 
thev did it. 



I — wQl I Nashville women are big-time fans of the smoky eye, says 

Carmen Mabry (below) of the city's popular Private Edition boutique and spa. Here's 
her fast— but still Country Music Award-worthy— take on the look: "Using a flat eyeliner 
brush, apply brown gel liner along your top lash line. Then, gently smudge the line with 
your fingertip, feathering it upward. To finish, apply brown or plum eyeshadow over the 
liner. It's an instant smoky eye in fewer steps, and in a softer palette." 




DO I NEED.. .HAIR OIL? 



Hair oil is a hot new beauty trend, but it's only 

worth buying if you have a dry scalp or frizziness. 

To help dryness, massage hair oil into your scalp 

30 minutes before you shower, then shampoo it out. (Tip for fine 

hair: Apply shampoo before you wet your hair, to help suds cut 

through the oil.) For frizz, use it in place of a shine serum for extra 

conditioning. "A few drops on damp hair before you blow-dry will 

instantly de-frizz," says Anna Maestrini of NYC's MetoDo Rossano 

Ferretti Hair Spa. We love Orofluido, $40, a blend of organic oils.

the PAUL MITCHELL 




lirty years ago, two friends changed the 
beauty industry forever with just $700. 
John Paul DeJoria and Paul Mitchell 
launched John Paul Mitchell Systems with a three- 
product professional hair care system. They named the 
brand Paul Mitchell* (he was the hairdresser of the two). 

The company faced plenty of challenges. The duo 
couldn't even afford color ink, which resulted in the 
brand's now-famous black and white packaging. 
But their winning strategy— offering salons the first 
money-back guarantee in the hair care industry— led 
John Paul Mitchell Systems to become one of the most 
successful and fastest growing U.S. companies, with over 
100 products sold in over 100,000 hair salons and over 
100 schools today. 

The company is devoted to earth-friendly 
practices— being the first hair care business to publicly 
oppose animal testing, harvesting botanicals without 
harming the environment and harnessing the sun's 
energy with solar panels on the eco-friendly Awapuhi 
farm— all efforts to make the world a better, safer place.

There's no need to 
deny yourself a 
morning cup of joe, 
but for the 4 p.m.

polyphenols.

EVERY NIGHT, APPLY A FOOT CREAM and you'll get 
back to baby feet (well, almost). Choose one with a hefty dose

PRESCRIPTION RETINOIDS WORK WONDERS. 
"They shed dead skin cells, even out pigmentation, and help 
unclog pores," says dermatologist Frederic Brandt, M.D. Thus: 
more glowiness, fewer wrinkles and breakouts. Ask your 
dermatologist for a sample of Refissa or Atralin, the newer, 
gentler retinoids with moisturizers built in. 



DON'T JUST DRINK YOUR WATER, EAT IT. 
"Raw fruits and vegetables have 'structured water,' which your 
cells absorb much better than plain water," says dermatologist 
Howard Murad, M.D., author of The Water Secret. "Eating a 
three-ounce cucumber is like drinking three ounces of water that 
brings with it minerals, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatories." 



Good posture takes years off. 
(Think of how a wizened old lady 
hunches over.) Align your body so ears

UP YOUR INTAKE OF ANTI-INFLAMMA- 
TORY SPICES, such as turmeric, ginger, 
and cinnamon. Every time inflammation is 
triggered inside your body (say, when 
you're exposed to air pollution), it puts a 
strain on your system, including skin. 
"Ingesting ingredients that reduce 
inflammation can really affect 
fine lines," Brandt notes.

And finally, most importantly, wear broad-spectrum sunscreen,

THE 

MANICURIST 

SAYS: 

Everyone's nails suffer in the 
fall because the air is suddenly 
so much drier, explains 
Leon-McCormack. Her 
remedy: Sneak in a little more 
pampering (we know, 
twist your arm). "It's 
an important time to 
get or give yourself 
regular manicures," 
she explains. "People 
think a manicure is all 
about the color, but that's just 
the finishing touch. It's about 
the care of your nails, including 
shaping and pushing back 
cuticles." In between manis, 
keep nails hydrated with a 
moisturizer or a nail oil that 
contains fast-absorbing 
vitamin E. And always use 
a strengthening base coat 
and top coat that contain 
ingredients like protein, for "a 
little extra protection against 
the elements," she says. 




nails are a 

mess— splitting and 
peeling. What's up? 




THE 

DERMATOLOGIST 

SAYS: 

With the onset of cold and 
flu season, you're probably 
washing your hands and using 
hand sanitizers a lot more, and 
all that repeated exposure to 
water and alcohol 
can dry out your 
nails. Unfortunately, 
Waldorf says, 
"there's no quick 
fix once nails 
become brittle — 
they have to grow 
out." But if you take care of the 
skin around your nails, they'll 
look better right away. Slather 
on a hand cream with 
ingredients such as glycerin, 
petrolatum, and dimethicone, 
then wear a pair of cotton 
gloves to bed. It seems 
old-fashioned, but gloves really 
will help the cream penetrate 
for more intense moisturizing.

AL 
DIETICIAN 
SAYS: 

"Nails that are brittle, discolored, 
peeling, or splitting can be 
an indication of a nutrient 
deficiency— especially if you're 
a vegetarian, since meats are a 
rich source of highly 
absorbable iron," 
Zied says. If you're 
low on iron— as about 
9 percent of women 
ages 12 to 49 are— 
supplements can help, but Zied 
recommends food as the best 
first defense. So dig in to 
iron-rich chicken, beef, and 
clams, or plant sources such 
as fortified cereals, soybeans, 
lentils, and kidney beans. And 
boost your intake of vitamin C, 
which can help your body 
better absorb iron. Biotin, 
a B vitamin, is also key for 
healthy nails; find it in 
whole-wheat bread, egg 
yolks, and cheese.

ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT: 

FAMILY DINNER 
CAN BE BREAKFAST 

Yes, research does show that kids who gather 
around the table with their families for evening meals 
are more likely to have a healthier diet and are less 
likely to experiment with alcohol and drugs. But this 
one's for you, crazy-busy moms: "There's nothing 
magical about dinner on its own," says David 
Dickinson, Ph.D., an education expert who has 
studied family mealtime issues. Experts say that 
what matters most are quality conversations and 
interactions between parent and child at any hour 
of the day. So just make the most of breakfast, the 
car ride to school, or story time at night, -sarahjio

A surprising 

way to boost 

willpower 




Whether you're starting a 

new flossing regimen or 

launching a workout plan, 

doing something kind 

may help you stick to it, 

says psychologist Kurt 

Gray, Ph.D. In a recent 

study, Gray gave people a dollar, with the 

option to pocket it or give it away — and 

those who donated the cash were able to 

hold a five-pound dumbbell for 15 percent 

longer. "The act of kindness gave people 

extra willpower and made them stronger," 

he says. "You can achieve more when you 

think of yourself as someone who makes 

good things happen." — megan baker

The hidden benefit 

of exercise for kids: 

It makes them smarter! T-ball, soccer, 
chasing the cat around the house in a dinosaur 
costume— it doesn't matter how your child 
gets his physical activity, but getting plenty of 
it might help him do better in school. Physically 
fit middle-school-aged kids scored up to 
20 percent higher on standardized tests than 
those who were less active, a new study from 
the University of California, Los Angeles found. 
While it's not clear exactly how fitness plays a 
role, earlier research showed that exercise may 
actually create healthy changes in the brain, 
says study author Christian Roberts, Ph.D. One 
good way to get any kid moving more: Set time 
limits on TV, video games, and computer use— 
if they're not glued to a screen indoors, they'll 
get their butts outdoors. — s.j. 



MAN MEDICINE 

foe heard that men 
should do self-checks 
fir testicular cancer. 
Is that true? Isn't their 
normal everyday 
ha ndl/ng en o ugh f! 

"Ha, ha— very funny. But this is 
serious! Testicular cancer is the 
most common type of cancer for 
men in their 30s and 40s, and it's 
highly treatable when detected early. 
Even if your guy seems to have his 
hands down his pants a lot, truly 
checking himself involves more 
than the usual adjusting. Once a 
month, every man should roll each 
testicle gently between his fingers, 
looking for hard lumps. If he feels 
one— or notices that either testicle is 
enlarged— he should see a urologist. 
Swelling and lumps could also 
mean an infection, hernia, cyst, or 
vein problems." —billy Goldberg, m.d.. 
assistant prolessoi ol emergency medicine at New 
York University School of Medicine in New York City 
and co-author of Lei's Play Doctor 



WHAT'S UP WITH 
ALL THE TWINS? 

If you feel like you're seeing twins and triplets everywhere, it's 
not your imagination: The number of women having multiples 
has jumped 50 percent in the last 30 years. The knee-jerk reac- 
tion is to blame it on the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF), but a 
new study by the March of Dimes doesn't back that up. A bigger 
reason may be fertility drugs— namely clomiphene (Clomid) and 
injectible gonadotropins— that are regularly prescribed as afirst- 
line treatment for women having 
trouble getting pregnant. "Drugs are 
too often used as a shortcut instead 
of looking for the causes of infertil- 
ity, like low sperm count or endo- 
metriosis," says Richard Dickey, M.D, 
Ph.D., medical director of the Fertil- 
ity Institute ofNew Orleans. "Patients 
need to know that these drugs in- 
crease the chance of multiples and 
what that means for babies." Mul- 
tiples are much more likely to be bom 
prematurely, putting them at risk 
for developmental delays. Dickey's 
advice: If you're having a rough time 
conceiving, see a specialist and in- 
vestigate underlying causes before 
opting for drugs. —BETH HOWARD

FREE WAYS TO CUT ALL 
YOUR HEALTH RISKS 



Insurance premiums, co- 
pays, gym fees— it can be 
pricey to stay healthy. But 
these research-backed 
tricks don't cost a cent: 

Step outside. Soaking 
up 15 minutes of sun 
(without sunscreen) two 
times a week can help your 
body produce sufficient 
levels of vitamin D, which 
has been linked to a 
lower risk of osteoporosis 
and breast cancer. The 
vitamin may also protect 
you from inflammatory 
bowel disease, Crohn's 
disease, and other 
digestive illnesses, says 
Jun Sun, Ph.D., assistant 



professor of medicine at 
the University of Rochester 
(NY) Medical Center. A 
recent study conducted 
by Sun and her colleagues 
suggests that vitamin D 
may help balance the 
naturally occurring bacteria 
in your digestive tract. 

Switch your cereal. 

You know you're supposed 
to eat breakfast for a million 
different reasons, but here's 
one more: People prone to 
canker sores are more likely 
to have low levels of folate 
and B-12— two nutrients

as Total Whole Grain

Phillips] is ill, he takes to the couch and pulls his hoodie over his 
head; suddenly he's all about sugary cereals and bad TV," Julie 
Bowen, who plays Claire on Modem Family, told REDBOOK. This 
regression isn't her imagination: A classic British study found that 
men were more likely to overrate cold symptoms than women. One 
way to help him feel better fast? Urge him to drink water. "You lose a 
lot of fluids from fever and blowing your nose," says Jim Sears, M.D., 
cohost of the talk show The Doctors. If severe symptoms last more 
than a few days, ask him to see an M.D. "Men 
avoid the doctor too much," Sears says. "But 
bad colds can turn into bronchitis or worse."

QMy husband and I joked about 
having a menage a trots, then 
later he said he'd like to do it 
for real. I'm not interested at all! But 
what does this mean about our mx life? 

A Sex with more than one woman is such a common 
male fantasy that it's almost a mandatory scene 
in any porno. Your husband probably took your 
joking as a sign that you have this fantasy too. The 
idea obviously makes you uncomfortable — and 
for some couples I've encountered, threesomes have been 
a jealousy-inducing disaster— so you're right to say no. Just 
know that your husband's curiosity doesn't mean he's not 
satisfied sexually or that he loves you any less. Talk to him 
and tell him that you weren't serious and simply don't want 
to share him. But does he have any fantasies that involve 
just the two of you? Ask him — and try that instead! 





QIget chronic urinary tract 
infections and feel like I'm 
constantly on antibiotics. Is 
there any way to break the cycle? 

A Yes! I've helped lots of women reduce the number of 
urinary tract infections (UTIs) they get by taking a few 
precautionary measures. As you probably know, sex is 
the most common cause of a UTI, which occurs when 
bacteria that normally live on the vulva are pushed into 
the urethra. So start making of habit of urinating before and 
after sex to flush bacteria from your urethra. Giving the area a 
quick wash with a mild soap at these times may help too. And 
for 24 hours after sex of any kind (oral sex included), drink a lot 
of water to boost the volume of urine and clear out even more 
germs. I also recommend that women with chronic UTIs sip a 
glass of natural, unsweetened cranberryjuice or take cranberry 
tablets each day— the acids in cranberries make it more difficult 
for bacteria to stick to the walls of the bladder and urethra. And 
if you have to go to the bathroom, go! Regularly waiting too long 
to urinate can increase the odds of infection. If these changes 
don't reduce the frequency of your UTIs, see your doctor to rule 
out an underlying medical cause, like diabetes. 



CASE HISTORY: SHE ALMOST HAD AN "OOPS!" PREGNANCY 



I'll never forget the morning I got a call from a patient who 
was in a panic because the condom she and her husband 
had used during sex the night before had broken. She 
was in her early 40s, a mom of three, and the thought of 
a fourth pregnancy brought her to tears. To make matters 
worse, she was in the most fertile part of her cycle. Since 
emergency-contraceptive pills are now available over the 
counter to adults without a prescription, I suggested that 



she get to a pharmacy within 72 hours to buy either Plan B 
One-Step or the generic version, called Next Choice. (Both 
are 89 -percent effective.) Women like this patient of mine will 
soon have a third option: The Food and Drug Administration 
recently approved a new, more effective prescription 
emergency contraceptive, Ella, that can be taken up to five 
days after sex. We're all capable of mistakes, so it's nice to 
know there are options for "oops!" moments.

We've all muttered, "Ugh, this 
job is killing me!" at some 
point or other. But listening 
to Lori Bizzoco, 42, a public 
relations executive in Ocean- 
side, NY, you'd think her job was, literally, 
a machete-wielding maniac. "I couldn't look 
down at my BlackBerry for more than five 
minutes anymore," she says. "It felt like 
someone had taken a knife and stabbed me 
in the neck. The pain ran down my shoul- 
ders and all through my back." Lori didn't 
just ache when she was hunched over her 
smartphone; it became chronic, and at one 
point she couldn't get out of bed for a week. 
Eventually, she abandoned her 15-year career in PR and became 
a writer instead. The advice she wishes she'd known sooner? 
That simply by holding your device at eye level, instead of slouch- 
ing over it the way most of us naturally do, you can relieve some

professor of medicine at the University of 
Maryland Medical School in Baltimore and 
author of Body for Life for Women. "But 
they usually don't make the connection 
between their working environment and 
these health issues until I point them out." 
Peeke places part of the blame on the still- 
iffy economy. "People are shortchanging 
themselves by skipping lunch and snacks, 
coming in early and/or leaving late for fear 
of losing their jobs," she says. "I believe 
chronic stress is epidemic." Whether you

research focused mainly on what people did after work 
hours— but those of us who sit on the job need to take 
note too, urges American Cancer Society epidemiologist 
Alpa Patel, Ph.D., who was the lead author of one of the 
studies. "Being seated is the most passive thing a worn an 
can do, aside from lying down," she explains. "So the more 
time spent that way, the less energy you "re expending, 
and the more likely a woman is to die early." 
How lo stay healthy: The way to ward off both back strain 
and the scarier, more serious health effects of sitting is 
fairly simple. "For five minutes every hour, get up and do 
something— I tell my patients to set an alarm or put it on 
their calendars," Peeke says. A trip to the bathroom or the 
watercooler works, but the more active you can be, the 
better: "Tell people you re going on break, then head to the

staircase and go up and down a couple 
flights. Or go take a lap or two around the 
building." If low-back pain is an issue for 
you, add in some stretches too, at least once 
eveiy couple of hours, says Marni Hillinger, 
M.D., a physiatry resident at New York 
Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. 
An easy one she loves is the leg cross— just 
prop the ankle of one leg on the knee of 
your other, bend over and hold for several 
seconds, then switch sides. One last note 
for the desk-bound: If you spend all day 
sitting, try not to do the same all night. "TV-watching has 
been linked to everything from excess snackingto diabetes 
and heart disease," says Patel. The more active you can be 
during your off hours, the better it will be for your health. 

DO YOU TAKE CARE OF KIDS? 

Congratulations on the calories you're burning! With all 
the carrying and stroller-pushing, moms of young kids 



often have strong legs and practically ripped arms. But 
many of them also end up with soreness and tightness of 
the low back and shoulders, what should be called "mommy 
back." Momhood can be so hard on your body, in fact, that 
there's a whole group of medical experts who specialize 
in it: pre- and postpartum physical therapists. 
How to stay healthy: First, advice for women with younger 
kids. Lift with the legs when you pick up your child, like 
how you'd lift anything else that's heavy, especially if he's 
all the way down on the ground, says physical therapist 
Marianne Ryan, clinical director ofManhattan PT in New 
York City. And if you're tall, get stroller-handle extenders. 
"When you're using a stroller correctly, your arms should 
be bent at a 90- to 100-degree angle," she says. Mothers 
of older children maybe hunching over a steering wheel 
rather than a stroller, so while you're ferrying your kids 
around, try placing a rolled-up towel at the small of your 
back. It will encourage you to sit up straight and use your 
core muscles, reducing tension in your back. 

DO YOU TYPE CONSTANTLY? 

Spending 20 or more hours a week in front of a com- 
puter can put someone at risk of wrist injuries. Livia 
Blackburne, agraduate student in Cambridge, MA, often 
clocks 14 hours in one day. "I'm at the lab working on the 
computer about 40 hours a week, and I am also writing 
a book," she says. "So I'm at the keyboard all day and up 
typing all night." At just 28 years old, Livia has already- 
had pain in her wrists and forearms for seven years. "I'm 
currently in the middle of a flare-up and it's just shooting 
pains and aching all around the elbow," she says. For now, 
she's working around the issue by using voice-recognition 
software for some of her work. "That way I can just talk 
into my computer mic and don't have to type all of the 
time," she says. Physical therapy, wearing a wrist splint, 
or getting steroid injections may help relieve the pain of 
repetitive motion injuries for some women, says David 
Rempel, M.D., an occupational medicine doctor at the 
University of California, San Francisco. But often the 
damage is severe enough that surgery is the only real 
cure, he says. That's why prevention is so crucial. 
How to stay healthy: "When you're typing, keep your 
wrists in a neutral position," says John Lloyd, Ph.D., a 
certified ergonomist in South Florida— never rest them 
on your desk or hold them up too high. "Ideally, your 
forearms should be supported on armrests." Taking fre- 
quent breaks from your keyboard, at least a few minutes 
each hour, will help too. "The strain is cumulative. So if 
you have the option of calling someone instead of email- 
ing them at work, do it," he says. Women may want to be 
especially careful to take breaks during the week of their 
period. "During'that time of the month; your body retains 
water, including in the arms and wrists, which increases 
pressure on the nerves," Lloyd says. (Who knew?) ►

TURN ON TOMORROW 



DO YOU WORK NIGHTS? 

Some of the scariest job-related research 
out there is reserved for people who work 
while the rest of us are asleep. One major 
study found that night-shift nurses were 
m ore 1 i kely to end up getting breast cancer 
than those who worked during the day, 
and other new research found that night- 
shifters are more likely to have irritable 
bowel syndrome. Sleep disruption is the 
main culprit, researchers say, but eating 
habits may play a role too. "I would be up 
all night running around, have no time to 
eat, and would just grab fast food on my way 
home," says Olga Marrero, R.N., who spent 
six years working nights in the neonatal 




intensive care unit at a Chicago hospital. 
"I lost 25 pounds when I switched over to 
the day shift, and I doiv'ttake medication 
for my stomach anymore." 
How to stay healthy: Set a sleep schedule 
that will give you a solid seven or eight hours 
of shut-eye a day, and stick to it— even on 
the weekends if you can, says Joseph Cilona, 
Psy.D., a psychologist in New York City. It's 
not easy to sleep when it's light outside and 
your body naturally wants to be awake, so 
the National Sleep Foundation suggests 
wearing wraparound sunglasses on your 
commute home to minimize exposure to 
light. "Once you get home, decrease room 
temperature in the bedroom, pull down 
the shades, and use earplugs to block out 
interruptions," Cilona says. Napping during 
part of your "lunch" hour is another great idea 
if you can swing it. "Research has found that 
napping for about an hour can significantly 
cut back on detrimental effects of shift work, 
especially if you do it between midnight and 
early morning," he adds. And never skimp 
on sleep on your days off, says Cilona; you've 
got to catch up however you can! 



DO YOU STAND 

FOR HOURS ON END? 

On the positive side, your job is more active 
than someone who's stuck at a desk, so 
you've got some built-in protection against 
heart disease and obesity. That said, any- 
one who's ever walked around an amuse- 
ment park or museum for a day knows that 
after several hours on your feet, your legs 
just hurt. Women who stand for more than 
eight hours a day also have significantly 
higher rates of varicose veins than those 
who are on their feet less, research has 
found. "My varicose veins go all the way 
up to my thighs," says Amy Cox, 34, who 
waitresses and bartends in Philadelphia. 
"Also, during a long shift, my feet just ache 
and my ankles get swollen. I'll lean on 
something or sit whenever I can." 
How to stay healthy: It seems counter- 
intuitive, but after a long day of putting 
pressure on your legs and feet, the smartest 
thi ng to do is move them . "Sitti ng with your 
legs up can relieve engorged veins and sore- 
ness temporarily, but increasing circulation 
by moving around is the best thing," says 



110 REDBOOKMAG.COM 



HEALTH HEAD- 




Andrew Kwak, 
M.D., a varicose- 
vein expert in 
Bryn Mawr, PA. 
Fifteen minutes 
of brisk walking 
a day will soothe 
leg fatigue and 
reduce swelling, 
he says. Wearing 
compression or "support" stockings can 
also help. (Sure, they're ugly, but no one can 
see them under your work pants!) 

ARE YOU SUPER- 
STRESSED? 

Most of us have some degree of stress in 
our lives and at our jobs, and that's fine- 
even exhilarating. Where things get ugly 
is if the pressure becomes chronic and your 
body and brain are constantly awash in 
stress hormones like norepinephrine and 
Cortisol. That can lead to extra belly fat, 
and increased blood pressure and risk of 
heart disease, says business psychologist 



DebraCondren, Ph.D., author of Ambition 
Is Not a Dirty Word. During a particu- 
larly rough time last year, Amee Quiriconi, 
38, of Seattle, who owns a small company 
that manufactures eco-friendlycountertops, 
says the pressure took a hefty toll on her 
health. "I was more prone to emotional 
outbursts and anger," she says. "And I 
couldn't fall asleep. I'd lie in bed for hours. 
I felt like I couldn't turn off the stress when 
the day was over; it just multiplied." 
How to stay healthy: Is there a magic 
"pill" for stress? Some experts say yes, and 
that it's exercise— physical activity can stop 
the production of Cortisol and get rid of 
tension held in your muscles. Though any 
kind of physical activity will work, intense 
cardio like jogging or stair climbing may 
work best. One study from the University 
of Missouri in Columbia found that wom- 
en who ran for 30 minutes felt less stress 
and anxiety than those who did something 
a little easier. What else helps? Support, 
says Condren, whether it's from a therapist, 
friends, or even a group of women in the 



same industry. "I started to see a therapist 
so I could get things off my chest," says 
Amee. "Putting it all out there and asking 
for help was not something I was accus- 
tomed to doing, but it helped." 

Condren is also a big proponent of using 
music for stress relief. "Research shows 
that listening to music can change our 
psychological and physiological state in an 
instant," she says. "It can distract us from 
focusing on the stress at hand while simul- 
taneously lowering blood pressure and 
slowing pulse and heart rate." Try listening 
to Pandora Internet radio at low volume 
at your desk, or pop in headphones and 
play the most upbeat song on your iPod. 

No matter how you spend your days (or 
nights) on the job, know that ultimately, 
you, not the company that signs your pay- 
check, are in control of your health destiny,

Important Safety Information About CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) 



What is the most important information I should 
know about CIMZIA? 

CIMZIA is a prescription medicine that affects your 
immune system. CIMZIA can lower the ability of 
the immune system to fight infections. Serious 
infections have happened in patients taking 
CIMZIA, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections 
caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have 
spread throughout the body. Some patients have 
died from these infections. Your doctor should test 
you for TB before starting CIMZIA. Your doctor 
should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms 
of TB during your treatment with CIMZIA. 

Certain Types of Cancer 

There have been cases of unusual cancers in children and 
teenage patients using TNF-blocking agents. CIMZIA is not 
approved for use in pediatric patients. For people taking 
TNF-blocker medicines, including CIMZIA, the chances for 
getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. People 
with RA, especially more serious RA, may have a higher 
chance for getting a kind of cancer called lymphoma. 

Before starting CIMZIA, tell your doctor if you 

• Think you have on infection. You should not start taking 
CIMZIA if you have any kind of infection, are being 
treated for an infection or have signs of an infection such 
as fever, cough or flu-like symptoms or if you get a lot of 
infections or have infections that keep coming bock. 

• Have any open cuts or sores 

• Have diabetes or HIV 

• Hove TB, or have been in close contact with someone 
with TB 

• Were born in, lived in, or traveled to countries where 
there is more risk of getting TB. Ask your doctor if you 
are not sure. 

• Live or lived in certain parts of country (such as the Ohio 
and Mississippi River valleys) where there is an increased 
risk for getting certain kinds of fungal infections 
(histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis). These 
infections may develop or become severe if you take 
CIMZIA. If you do not know if you have lived in these 
types of areas, ask your doctor. 

• Hove or have hod hepatitis B 

• Have or have had any type of cancer 

• Have congestive heart failure 



CRD057-0510A 



■ Hove seizures, any numbness or tingling, or a disease 
that affects your nervous system such as multiple sclerosis 

• Are scheduled to receive a vaccine. Do not receive a live 
vaccine while taking CIMZIA 

• Are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or 
breastfeeding. CIMZIA hos not been studied in pregnant 
or nursing women. 

• Especially tell your doctor if you lake: Kinerel"' 
(anakinra), Orencia- (abatacept), Riluxan" ' (rituximab), 
Tysabri- (natalizumab), or another TNF blocker. You 
have a higher chance for serious infections when 
taking CIMZIA with these medicines. You should not 
take CIMZIA while you take one of these medicines. 

After starting CIMZIA, if you get on infection, any sign 
of an infection including a fever, cough, flu-like symptoms, 
or have open cuts or sores on your body, call your doctor 
right away. CIMZIA can make you more likely to get 
infections or make any infection that you may have worse. 

What are the possible side effects of CIMZIA? 
CIMZIA can cause serious side effects including: 

Heart Failure including new heart failure or worsening 
of heart failure you already have; Nervous System 
Problems such as Multiple Sclerosis, seizures, or 
inflammation of the nerves of the eyes; Allergk 
Reactions. Signs of an allergic reaction include a skin 
rash, swollen face, or trouble breathing; Hepatitis B 
virus reactivation in patients who carry the virus in 
their blood. In some cases, patients have died as a result 
of hepatitis B virus being reactivated. Your doctor should 
monitor you carefully during treatment with CIMZIA if you 
carry the hepatitis B virus in your blood; Blood Problems. 
Your body may not make enough of the blood cells that 
help fight infections or help stop bleeding; Immune 
reactions including a lupus-like syndrome. Symptoms 
include shortness of breath, joint pain, or a rash on the 
cheeks or arms that worsens with sun exposure. 

Call your doctor right away if you develop any of 
the above side effects or symptoms. 

The most common side effects of CIMZIA are: 
upper respiratory infections (flu, cold), rash, and urinary 
tract infections (bladder infections). 

Other side effects have happened in some people 
including new psoriasis or worsening of psoriasis you 
already have and injection site reactions. 

You are encouraged to report negative side 
effects to FDA. Visit www.tda.gov/medwatch,

Avoid this 
big marriage 
mistake 

"Half the divorces I've seen could have been 
prevented if the couples had said 'I'm sorry' 
the right way," says divorce lawyer and 
couples mediator Laurie Puhn, author of 
Fight Less, Love More. "The best apologies 
acknowledge a mistake and show how you'll 
change." Her surprisingly simple steps to the 
perfect mea culpa: 

Skip the but's. "All a but does is deflect 
blame," Puhn says. The better b-word? 
Because. "The point is to get to the root of the 
problem so you can discuss it constructively." 
Say your husband's upset you spilled a secret 
about him to your best friend — you know she's 
trustworthy, but he feels betrayed. You could 
say, "I'm sorry because I broke your trust." 
Suck up your pride. No matter how small 
the misstep, "acknowledge how significant it 
may be to your partner," Puhn says. "Say, 'I 
crossed a line and I'm sorry' to convey that 
you see how your action impacted him." 
Show you'll change. Explain how you'll 
avoid making the same mistake. Try, "Next 
time, before I pass along something you've 
told me, I'll check with you." Even a major 
grudge-holder will be willing to forgive if he 
knows you respect his feelings. — n.y.

Sex life road test: Dress up for grown-ups! 

In honor of Halloween, we asked two usually straitlaced readers to surprise their 
husbands with a private costume party. Here's what happened. 



COUPLE #1: H.B. and R.B., 
Colchester, VT 

SHE SAYS: "I'd never done any- 
thing like this before, but I loved. 
dressing up like a hot cop. I 
told my husband he was under 
arrest. (He seemed quite happy.) 
I pushed him up against the wall 
and frisked him all over. I said he was 
bad for hiding something in his pants, 
and insisted he strip so I could investigate! 
I kept my police cap on all night long. It 
was much hotter than lingerie." 
HE SAYS: "Good-bye inhibitions, hello super- 
sexy wife here to arrest me! This is undeni- 
ably the best surprise I've ever received." 
PASSION RATING: SMOKING! 



COUPLE #2: R.D. and CM., Gainesville, FL 
SHE SAYS: "I slipped into asexy nurse uniform, 
then snuck up behind my husband and said, 
'I'm here for your appointment." He looked 
shocked and then thrilled— and then we 
totally cracked up together. I admit that I 
felt awkward at first, but then I got really 
into checking him out with the stethoscope 
and examining all of his parts. This was so 
much fun, and it taught me that it's worth 
making the extra effort to spice things up in 
the bedroom." 

HE SAYS: "When I first saw my wife, I thought 
I was hallucinating! What's sexier than being 
caught off guard? It's so true that the most 
erogenous zone is the one between your ears." 
PASSION RATING: SMOKING!

12 things we wish 
we'cTsaid at the altar 

y DEAREST WIFE, I PROMISE... 

...never to point out that you and your mom have the exact same way 
of laughing. Or dealing with stress. Or hitting a forehand. Or folding 
napkins. In fact, you are so not like your mother, it's kind of crazy. 

. . .not to keep track of your orgasms like our 
sex life is the Kentucky Derby and you're a horse 
I've bet on, 

...never to clean horizontal surfaces thoroughly. Or at all. Sorry, it's just not in me. 

. . .that I truly meant that bit about "for richer or 
poorer." You too, right? Honey? 

...to always stand behind you. Sure, emotionally, but most especially 
when you're bending over to load the dishwasher. 

...not to ask you to paint your face in my team colors, though they do go so well with your hair. 

V DARLING HUSBAND, I PROMISE... 

...that should something ever happen to me, 
I will not be mad if you remarry. As long as she 
is not thinner than me. 

. . .to unearth my honeymoon 
lingerie and wear it some time 
before our 50th anniversary. 

...that I will always stop what I'm doing to help you find things in 
the refrigerator, even when they are so close they could bite you. 

...for richer? HAHAHAH AHA! 

...to make sure you never, ever have to select 
outfits for our children. No, really, I'll do it! 

...that after Facebooking old boyfriends, I will always think to 
myself, / so married the right guy.

never keep 

Faking it in bed (for years). 
Crazy debt. Childhood 
abuse. Meet women who 
told their husbands these 
truths to save their marriages. 
Is it time to tell your secret? 
By Brenda Delia Casa 



Your husband knows you better than anyone. 
He knows what you look like naked, and with- 
out makeup, and first thing in the morning. 
He knows that you snore like alinebacker and 
what you really think about your friends' par- 
enting skills. But does he need to know everything? Of 
course not! Harmless secrets— say, that you didn't love 
your engagement ring as much as you pretended you did — 
are no biggie. It's the deeper ones, often about touchy top- 
ics like money and sex, that could be harming your rela- 
tionship in ways you never guessed. In order to stay happy, 
experts say you've got to tell him if... 

1... you've got money issues. 
A fewyears ago Tara, 40, took out several loans with- 
out her husband Chris's knowledge to make some pur- 
chases for her pet-grooming business. It started out small— 
a doggie mural here, a new dryer there— but soon she was 
in debt for a whopping S47,000. "I got a post office box in 
another town just for bills," she says. "I would throw them 
away there because I was so afraid Chris would find out." 
But when he came to her to talk about refinancing their 
home, she knew it was time to fess up: "He yelled for near- 
ly two hours, but then he said, Why didn't you come to me 
for help before it got so bad?'" It may appear that the issue 
here is only money, but it's also about trust, says consum- 
er finance expert Dayana Yochim, author of The Motley 
Fool's Guide to Couples C? Cash. "We yell about dollar 
amounts, but often we're thinking, I don't trust you — to 
handle our money well, provide for me, or forgive my mis- 
takes," she says. A big reason couples don't trust each 
other? They don't talk! "Before this happened, we didn't 
communicate at all— we bickered and blamed,"Tarasays. 
"But now we discuss issues and delegate tasks. I worked 
hard to repay the money but harder to earn back Chris's 
trust." A new survey found that more than 25 percent of 
respondents had hidden purchases from their partners— 
but the same sort of trust issues may also be involved if 
you're secretly stashing money, not blowing it. Samantha* 28, 
has not one, not two, but three secret savings accounts. 
That money is almost like an escape hatch that protects 
her from having to feel fully committed to the marriage, 
Yochim says. But to make a marriage work, you've got to 
be all in— not straddling the fence. "Coming clean about 
this will be an opportunity for Samantha to show that she's 
committed, and also to address whatever issues led her to 
believe she might need that in-case-we-break-up-fund in 
the first place," she says. 

2 ...there's a chance your 
relationship is in trouble. 

Five years into her marriage, Nina*, 37, started feeling 
restless. She still loved her husband, but being a full-time 
wife and mother had started to feel monotonous. So when 
a friend told her about ashleymadison.com, a site for men

and women lookingfor affairs, the idea of 
posting a profile was thrilling. She signed 
up "just for fun," but the messages started 
pouring in. The attention felt good, and 
two months later, flirty emails she'd been 
exchanging with one guy turned into cyber- 
sex, then a real-life affair. It went on for 
eight months before she broke it off— and 
guilt began to eat away at her. "I started 
seeing a therapist, who convinced me to 
tell my husband because she was sure he 
could sense something," Nina says. "I was 
so scared he would blowup and leave, but 
when 1 finally told him, there were just 
tears." Many people who cheat feel, at least 
at first, like they had good reason, says 
Jennine Estes, a marriage and family 
therapist in San Diego. But you can never 
assume your partner knows that you're 
feeling ignored, unloved, or not desired. 
"His devastation brought home how deeply 
I wounded him," Nina says. After spend- 
ing a few nights apart, they decided they 
wanted to work on their marriage— and 
that's when the couple finally began to 
communicate. "We never really addressed 
our frustrations with each other before 
this happened," Nina says. "But once we 
started talking, we were able to open up 
about our unhappiness and resolve it."The 
key, Estes says, is to bring up scary feelings 
like boredom or resentment 
before any true damage is 
done, or anyone steps out. 
"If you ever think your mar- 
riage may be in danger, 
speak up quickly, no matter 
how much it hurts."

uiihoppy 

in bed. 

Faking an orgasm is some- 
thing many women will 
admit to one another in the cone of silence, 
but telling their man is a different story. 
"There are a lot of women who aren't hav- 
ing orgasms, but they won't admit it because 
they think something's wrong with them 
or because they don't want to hurt their 
husband's feelings," says couples therapist 
Karen Gail Lewis, Ed.D., author of Why 
Don't Y'ou Understand? Lewis has helped 
dozens of couples through tough sex stuff, 
but the case that stands out for her is one

in which the wife had been faking it with 

her husband for the entire 17 years they'd 

been married. Though the woman, let's 

call her Sally, was able to climax on her 

own, sex with her husband was unfulfilling 

and left her feeling frustrated and helpless. 

Instead of risking a painful conversation, 

Sally kept it to herself and put on a show. 

"She never really enjoyed sex with him, so 

faking it seemed like the best way to get it 

over with," says Lewis. But ignoring your 

own sexual needs can lead 

to major resentment, so 

Lewis encouraged Sally to 

tell the truth. She admitted 

her deception to her husband 

during a session one day, and 

instead ofbeing defensive or 

blaming, he turned to Sally 

lead to major and said ' " H ° wsad - lt>s sad 

for both of us that you didn't 
resentment , feel comfortable talking to 

me about this." It was like 17 
years of tension had melted 
away— and although it took time and work, 
the couple made it through. They're not 
just squeaking by, either. Lewis says they 
started introducing new techniques into 
their sex life and now report that they're 
both, honestly, satisfied.

body. "I was frustrated that my figure 
wasn't bouncing back like I had hoped 
it would," she says. Just five weeks 
after giving birth, she hit the gym, 
and when she stepped on the scale 
in the locker room, she was shocked. 
"I knew I had gained a lot, but I'm 
only 5-foot-3, and when I saw the 
number 174, 1 went crazy," she says. 
She threw up her food that afternoon 
and continued to purge secretly for 
the next year. Then one day, while 
on her knees in a McDonald's bath- 
room, Janet looked over at her 
18-month-old daughter. "It struck 
me that she was becoming more aware 
of her surroundings, and I didn't want 
her to develop my problem," she says. 
A few days later, Janet had her first 
meeting with an eating-disorder 
specialist— but she still didn't tell her 
husband until weeks later, when she 
discovered she was pregnant with 
their second child. "I knew I had to 
tell him, so wrote him an email in 
order to allow him to process it in 
his own time," she says. 

While your body is always your own, 
you have to understand that once you're 
married, your health affects everyone 
in your family, Estes says. And they 
have a right to know where you stand, 
not only for their own protection but 
so they can help you. Janet's husband 
was 100 percent supportive. "He 
stopped mentioning weight in any 
capacity, threw out the scales in the 
house, and started complimenting 
me more," she says. "Before opening 
up to him, I thought I needed to 
handle everything on my own, but 
now I see him as my teammate." 

5 ...you've had a 
traumatic past. 

Tough events that take place during 
childhood, college — whenever — don't 
just affect us right when they happen. 
The aftershocks of horrible experi- 
ences, especially if they're sexual in 
nature, nearly always influence the 
way we are in our relationships, Estes 
says. As a kid, Veronica, 45, was re- 
peatedly molested by a male relative 
who had convinced her she'd get in 



trouble if she told. For 23 years, she confided 
in no one, not even her husband. "I guess I 
always thought my husband would ultimately 
disappoint me in some way like my relative 
had," she says. "My husband couldn't under- 
stand why I was so distant, and I didn't trust 
him enough to explain." The turning point 
came during a private therapy session in 
which Veronica spoke for the first time about 
her abuse. It left her feeling so empowered 
that she told her husband the very next day. 
"At that moment, I felt my soul lift up. Now, 
knowing that I have his support no matter 
what has changed the landscape of my life 
and our relationship, even just in little ways, 
like finally letting myself enjoy cuddling 
with him," she says. 

Often, what makes a person hold on to 
their secrets is fear. "People who hide informa- 
tion from their mates do it because they think 
they'll be judged or deemed less lovable," Estes 
says. "But keeping things hidden is stressful 
and can wind up creating distance between 
you, because you're guarded or on edge. As 
scary as it is, if you open up and expose your 
scars, you could see major benefits." ©

THE MULLET 

"I wish someone hail 
said, 'Cut thai hair!" 



Fans of Glee are pretty hard-core— but no 
doubt you've had intense fan experiences over 
your 28-year career. What's your craziest story? 
One time, when I was on General Hospital 
[John played rock 'n' roll drummer Blackie 
Parrish for his first acting gig], I opened the 
closet in my dressing room and there was a 
naked girl in there— like, completely naked. 
It was pretty wild. I didn't know what to do. 
Should I call security? Should I buy her lunch? 
I gave her a jacket and sent her on her way. 

You probably had a kajillion onscreen kisses 
as a soap star. But what woman in real life 
taught you the most about kissing? 
When I was 16 or 17, 1 remember kissing one 
of my first girlfriends, Kim Anderson, under 
a stairwell at Disneyland. I'll never forget that 
feeling. I love to kiss. To me, a good kisser is 
really important. 

Have you ever given your two younger sisters 
advice about the most important qualities to 
look for in a man? 

I would tell them to look for someone with 
integrity, who's hardworking, honest, and 
family-oriented— like our dad. 

While we're on the topic of dream men, Will 
Ferrell and John C. Reilly said in Step Brothers 



that you are the guy they would want to sleep 
with if they were women. If you were a woman, 
what guy would you want to sleep with? 
It would have to be Will Ferrell. I like his curly 
hair and the fact that he'll get naked at the drop 
of a hat. I find that sexy in a man. [Laughs] 

But back to women: What characteristic 
always catches your interest? 
A good sense of humor. I once dated someone 
who worked at McDonald's. She came up and 
asked if I wanted a Big Mac. 

The best way to your heart seems to 
be food. But how do you woo a woman? 
Sing to her? You have toured with the 
Beach Boys for years. 
I have never been so calculating as to sing 
some Barry White song to get a girl. But I do 
think it's very romantic to cook dinner and sit 
around the piano at night and sing together. I 
like to sing with people, whether they're good 
or not. I like when guests come over early and 
we chop veggies and talk and play music. 

Speaking of group fun, you were on the 
posse-comedy Entourage this season too. 
Can you let us ladies in on what men talk 
about when they get together? 

Women! — Nicole yorio

What you never know about 
a guy until you marry him 



Let us guess: Someone kidnapped the sexually attentive, 

financially solvent man you fell in love with and replaced him with 

your husband, right? Aaron Traister explains the phenomenon, 




Red book 
columnist Aaron 
Traister lives in 
Philadelphia with 
his wife and two 
kids. Read his blog 
at redbookmag 
.com/aaron. 



My wife's guiltiest TV pleasures are The 
Bachelor and The Bachelor -ette. (I refuse 
to include General Hospital as a guilty 
TV pleasure, because, frankly, that's 
just quality entertainment.) I am not 
a fan, but because I enjoy spending time with my wife 
at the end of a long day, I have been known to sit in on 
a rose ceremony from time to time. 

Karel's favorite complaint about the show is that if the 
contestants were really serious about finding their soul 
mates, the dates would involve cleaning a shared batiiroom 
or babysitting a 3-year-old who has just eaten an entire 
bag of chocolate chips. To her, it comes as no surprise that 
many of these relationships devolve into the stuff of tab- 
loid fodder once the cameras are off and the couple is no 
longer floating around the French Riviera in a hot-air 
balloon filled with puppies and champagne. In the 
real world, the hot-air balloon is a 2003 Honda 
Element with a wonky rear brake light, the French 
Riviera is the train station in Trenton, NJ, and 
there will be an argument over directions that 
will result in the GPS getting thrown outthe 
window. That's just how real-world relation- 
ships work, Karel says. 

Initially, I was in 
total agreement with 
her assessment. But 
the more I pon- 
dered it, the more 
I started to think 
she was missing 
the point of the 
show. For all the 
marriage talk dur- 
ing the last few 
episodes of each 
season, it is actually 
a show about dating. 
And when it comes to 
dating, the last thing 
any guy wants to do is 
show a woman anything 



resembling real. From the physical to the financial, every 
aspect of a single guy's life is as cleverly edited and over- 
produced as any episode of The Bachelor. 

I learned this a decade ago during my tenure as a 
bouncer at a New York City bar. There I saw all the 
deceptive ways men present themselves during the 
courting process. Looking back, I realize I was guilty 
of them too. Karel dated a very different Aaron than 
the one she settled into a long-term relationship with. 
Most women do. Let me explain. 

Single men are dripping in cash. 

From the guy who casually assured his lady friend "not 
to worry about it" when it came to buying drinks, and 
then, after she was out of earshot, pleaded with the 
bartender for a break on the next round, to the 
regular who would scrawl his phone number on 
phony ATM receipts and give them to girls so they 
might catch a glimpse of how much he was (not 
really) worth, every guy in the bar wanted to 
look like he was in the black. I was no differ- 
ent. Dating Aaron always paid for dinners 
and movie tickets, not to mention the flow- 
ers he brought to Karel at least once a week. 

What Karel didn't see: All the cash that Dating 
Aaron was spending on flowers, wine, and Italian 
food was coming directly out of Real Aaron's rent, 
which he would then frantically scramble to pay 
at the end of the month (usually late). Real Aaron 
had a job but no bank account— he managed his 
money using a complex system involving a 
check-cashing establish- 
ment and a couple of 
coffee cans. 

Karel was terrified 

of Real Aaron when 

she finally came to 

learn the truth about 

my financial situation, 

but by that time, it 

was too late: She 

was already

Single guys live for

Dating Aaron was always thoughtful and 
giving when it came to sex. Dating Aaron 
worked tirelessly to ensure his partner's 
happiness and satisfaction. Dating Aaron 
was a patient and imaginative lover. 

Real Aaron is as patient and imaginative 
a lover as a mountain gorilla in mating 
season. Working hard to ensure my part- 
ner's satisfaction is not my main priority 
now that I know she's committed for the 
long haul. I've discovered I'm 
pretty selfish when it comes 
to sex. Lemme put it like this: 
I know sex isn't a race, but it 
sometimes feels that way, and 
while I'd love to cross the fin- 
ish line at the same time, I 
don't want to get disqualified

she married Real Aaron, of the stubborn

Karel quickly picked up on the fact that 
as much as I love cultivating my "Pioneer 
Sheik" look, the beard will eventually 
get itchy, the unwashed shirt will start 
to smell, and I will, in the end, break 
down and clean up. I like to think she

So, was I guilty of false advertising? Oh, 
definitely. The only thing I can say in my 
defense (and possibly your guy's) is that a 
little dating dishonesty can be a sign of 
how hard he's fallen for you. I knew no 
one as amazing as Karel was waiting for 
a shot at a broke, smelly sex-ape. I saw my 
two futures— the one with her and the one 
without her— and I have no regrets about 
being a big phony to get what I wanted. 
I'm just thankful she fell for it, and then 
found something real in me to love. © 



Straight answer from the Whys Guy

should I clue into that

charge? — Rachael, CA 



Sachael: I here is never a 
wrong time for sex, and 
there is never a wrong time 
to initiate sex. Seriously, 



I could lose my big toe in 
a gruesome lawn-mower 
accident, and if Karel 
suggested we have hours 
of lovemaking before 
heading to the hospital, 
I'd take her upon it. 

After marriage, most

who's taking charge, 
we just want sex. Just 



remember this handy 
acronym: SAG— Sex 
Always Good. You 
probably wouldn't be able 
to keep up if I told you 
how much sex it would

man happy, so just worry 
about having enough sex 
to keep yourself happy, 
and you'll be all set.

CROCK-POT 

THE ORIGINAL SLOW COOKfR 




Bruce Dale _/or National Geographic 



Will the Internet kill magazines? 
Did instant coffee kill coffee? 

New technologies change many things. But not everything. 
You may surf, search, shop and blog online, but you still read 
magazines. And you're far from alone. 

Readership has actually increased over the past five years. Even 
the 18-to-34 segment continues to grow. And typical young adults 
now read more issues per month than their parents. Rather than 
being displaced by "instant" media, it would seem that magazines 
are the ideal complement. 

The explanation, while sometimes drowned out by the Internet 
drumbeat, is fairly obvious. Magazines do what the Internet doesn't. 
Neither obsessed with immediacy nor trapped by the daily news 
cycle, magazines promote deeper connections. They create 
relationships. They engage us in ways distinct from digital media. 

In fact, the immersive power of magazines even extends to 
the advertising. Magazines remain the number one medium 
for driving purchase consideration and intent. And that's essential 
in every product category. 

Including coffee.

So, your best friend's gone off the deep end and 
your mother-in-law's in league with the devil? It's all 
going to be fine— just follow Karen Karbo's advice. 



Her mom is a pain 

My 8-year-old daughter's best friend is a lovely 
girl. But thanks to her mom, playdates involve 
constant phone calls and parenting feedback 
("You shouldn't give her all that candy"), Now, 
because I work from home, this rnom is asking 
me to be a backup sitter when she comes home 
late! I don't want these issues to hurt my 
daughter's friendship. Advice? -a.r., 46, madison, wi 

For the good of all involved, forget about your daughter and her friend 
and focus on ymi for a moment. To keep from being steamrolled by 
this other mom, you need to figure out what you will and won't do in 
your dealings witb her. Babysitting, for example. Next time sbe asks 
you to watch her kid, say you can't; you have your own work to catch 
up on. In general, less interaction with her will reduce the amount of 
commentary on your parenting, so feel free to tell her you just can't 
talk when she calls compulsively during playdates. And feel free to 
turn down playdates when you're busy or the scheduling is tough. Your 
daughter might be disappointed, but you're also going to be modeling 
boundary-setting behavior for her — and that's an invaluable lesson. 



Grr... he wont stand up to his ex 

My boyfriend has a 10-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Her mother tells 
her that he will buy her things and take her places without asking him first. He wants 
to make amends for not being there for his daughter in the beginning, but am I right to 
want him to stand up to his ex? It's affecting our relationship. — v.m.. 26. Washington, dc 

You can tell him you're concerned about him, but what he chooses to do in terms of raising 
his child is out of your hands. Unless something happens that directly involves you— like 
if he were to get custody of h is daughter and you were expected to help care for her— you've 
got to let him handle his responsibilities as he sees fit. Focus on being a supportive adult 
in this little girl's life and let your guy negotiate the situation with her mom. Meanwhile, 
try to figure out whether you can fully accept his daddy-on-call status for the long haul. 



Is there a nice way to say, "Shut up"? 

Every once in a long while, I get a massage as a special treat. Unfortunately, I 
sometimes end up with a chatty masseuse who totally ruins the mood! I don't want 
to be rude, but how can I get her to be quiet? — a.b., 45, santamonica, ca

She's so 
cheap 

I have a friend who considers

The next time your friend has

C'mon, treat yourself." And when

that amount, plus half the tax. 

My point: You can be more 
open about how annoying you 
find her frugality, without hurt-

change. Or she might not. In 
that case, if being cheap is your

Rocket mom! 

Want tips on how to stay connected with your kids 
when you can't be with them? Listen to Nicole 
Stott— she does it from outer space. Not kidding. 

Talk about a long commute to work: This month, Nicole Stott, 
47, will say good-bye to her husband, Chris, her 8-year-old son, 
Roman, and the entire planet to spend two weeks working at the 
International Space Station. And that's a short trip; last year she 
was there for three months. Stott amazed us with her ideas for 
keeping in touch: 

When you're in space, how do you and Roman stay close? 
I can actually call home from the space station on a special phone, 
so Roman and I talk every night. We chat about what's going on 
at school, what books he's reading, and how his baseball season is 
going. It's amazing that I can help him with his homework whether 
I'm at the kitchen table or on orbit. Also, Roman and I wear 
matching yellow bracelets that say, "Mommy loves Roman." It's our 
special thing. 

It must be so cool for your son to have a mom who's been 
in space! Is he into it? 

Yeah, he's definitely interested. I make little videos for him about 
how life works in space, like, "This is how we brush our teeth" and 
"This is how the toilet works." He thinks it's funny that we don't use 
plates to eat because food just floats there. 

You've got two huge jobs: astronaut and mom. How do you 

make it all work? 
Having a grounded 
husband! I don't worry 
about being up in 
space because I know 
Chris loves being home 
taking care of our son. I 
also savor this amazing 
life I have: When I 
came back to earth last 
time, just being able to 
breathe fresh air and 
then give big hugs to 
my husband and my 
little munchkin was 
ethereal. — LINDSEY PALMER 



HOW HE DOES IT 

"I'm in awe of my wife's parenting, but we disagree 
on one thing: schedules. She believes in sticking to 
them; I don't. If I let my son stay up with me to watch 
the end of a game or read another chapter to my 
daughter, it's the difference between a memory and 
any other night. The kids may be tired the next day, 
but we al I su rvive . -danny evans, bio S ger, d«,i emu Mad 





WIIY KIDS' LIES 

AREN'T SO BAD 

When your toddler looks you in 
the eye and says, "Mommy, my 
doll broke it!" you're torn between 
laughing out loud at her alibi and 
worrying she'll become a mini 
Bernie Madoff. But research from 
the University of Toronto says 
that lying not only is a normal 
part of childhood but also might 
mean your kid is an extra-clever 
cookie. Researchers asked kids 
ages 3 to 8 to avoid peeking at a 
covered toy, then left the room for 
a few minutes. Virtually all the kids 
looked, but more than half denied 
it. "The best liars were the ones 
with the most highly developed 
executive function— they had 
the ability to plan and carry out 
actions," says study author Kang 
Lee, Ph.D. So the next time your 
kid drops a whopper, respect her 
smarts, then use the opening for 
a talk about why it's important to 
tell the truth. Honestly, that's your 
best policy. — marisacohen

Who's been sleeping 
in your bed? 

It's not just toddlers crawling under the covers with Mom and Dad. 

Plenty of older kids (Angelina and Brad's included!) are spending nights there too. 

Is this okay for them? What about their parents? Susan Dominus reports. 



The day she showed up at work with a black 
eye, Anna Mena, a department-store man- 
ager in New York City, could tell that her 
coworkers were alarmed. Finally, a close 
friend approached: Was everything fine at 
home? Mena admitted the truth: Her 5-year-old, who 
shared a bed with her and her husband most nights, had 
given her a swift kick in the face mid-slumber while fling- 
ing himself into a new position. Shed fled to the bathroom, 
crying tears of pain; her son slept right through it. 

"Wow," said her colleague, once convinced that Mena, 
42, wasn't a battered wife. "I guess it's time to get that kid 
out of your bed." Mena could not have agreed more. 

Two years later, the thrasher still flails his way through 
his sleep cycles next to his 
parents, despite their best 
efforts to get him to sleep 
on his own. His parents 
have been bruised. They 
have been thwarted. Now, 
says his mother, they are 
mostly resigned. 

Mena never thought she 
would be the kind of mom 
who puts up with a second- 
grader in her bed, though 
she is comforted by one

thing: "Every single one of my friends has a child who 
ends up visiting them at night." 

Cosleeping with babies is one of those hot-button issues 
that elicits sermonizing from otherwise reasonable par- 
ents on both sides of the debate. And no wonder, with the 
stakes so high: Bed-sharing puts babies at higher risk for 
sudden infant death syndrome (the position of the Amer- 
ican Academy of Pediatrics). Still, some attachment- 
parenting gurus insist it can be done safely, and that it's 
the only arrangement a loving parent could choose. 

Then there is the other family bed phenomenon— the 
more covert one, in which older children of 5 or 10 come, 
pitter-patter, into their parents' rooms in the middle of 
the night or start out sleeping there, kids who prefer 
Mom and Dad's bed to their own. Whether or not they 
deliberately make this sleep choice, parents often keep 
it a secret, concerned they'll be judged as overindulgent 
or codependent at best— or creepy and perverse at worst. 
Never mind what it suggests about their sex life. 

Angelina.Jolie, already something of a maternal icono- 
clast, has none of that shame: She recently told Vanity Fail' 
that she and Brad Pitt regularly let their six kids, ages 15 
months to 8 years, pile into their bed. When you've got that 
many, apparently, even a custom-made 9-foot bed won't 
shield you from the kids' nocturnal rustlings. "Mommy 
and Daddy are very tired the next morning," she said. 

Yeah, tell us about it. A growing number of parents are

squeezing their children into their standard kings and 
queens. Experts estimate that about 15 percent of fami- 
lies have children ages 5 and up with whom they share a 
bed for part or all of the night, several times a week. "Co- 
sleeping with grade-school children and beyond is much 
more common than anyone would imagine," notes James 
McKenna, Ph.D., a professor of anthropology who runs 
the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at the 
University of Notre Dame in South Bend, IN. "I've spoken 
to college kids who curl up at night with Mom and Dad. 
The older the child, the quieter parents get about it." 

Some experts link the trend to rising rates of breast- 
feeding, as moremoms start bed-sharing at birth— despite 
safety warnings — and never stop. Other parents just "find 
it hard to part with their kids at bedtime. Raised on a cul- 
ture of therapy, memoir, and Oprah, moms and dads today 
are exquisitely sensitive to the trials of childhood, which 
apparently includes the separations that occur on anightly 
basis— or would, if everyone stayed in their own beds. 

Sleeping together: 
What's okay, what's not 

Some parents will tell you that cosleeping can be a cozy, 
manageable comfort for a family. Such is the idyllic sce- 
nario Sherry Perdue, 46, and her husband, who run their 
own business in Blacksburg, VA, describe. Their 5- and 
7-year-olds fall asleep around 7:30 p.m. in their parents' 
bed, and the couple joins them later. "Their bunk bed is 
for play more than sleep," 
says Perdue. She feels 
closer to her children and 
cherishes morning to- 
gether time. "That's when 
my son feels comfortable 
bringing up anything, 
like a fight he had with 
his brother," she says. "I'm 
not sure he'd come to me 
during the day the way 
he does when he's quietly reflecting at that time." 

Many experts out there see nothing wrong with shar- 
ing a bed, as long as couples carve out intimate time for 
themselves. "If both parents agree on the arrangement 
and everyone gets enough sleep, cosleeping is absolutely 
fine," says Jodi Mindell, Ph.D., a psychologist and vice 
chair of the board of directors for the National Sleep 
Foundation. "It's a choice that families make." 

For certain parents, it's the only workable solution. 
Juliana Olivarez, 39, a kindergarten teacher and a single 
mother of two in Tucson, AZ, coslept with her son from 
birth to 1.3. "Otherwise, we'd never have gotten any sleep," 
she says. "He had night terrors when he slept alone." 

She tried thetechniques doctors recommended: offer- 
ing positive rewards, sitting by his bed in a folding chair 
and inching farther away each night. Nothing helped.

've spoken

and Dad." 




Friends gave her grief, but she had little patience for it: 
"These people don't have night after night of no sleep." 

Her son, now an independent, well-adjusted teen, still 
crawls into her bed on occasion. "I know, kids need bound- 
aries," she says. "Ill have boundaries when he moves out." 

Crowded and cranky 

Olivarez has thrown in the towel, but other parents 
persist in returning kids to their own beds, as often as 
20 times a night. "We've truly flunked the sleep part of 
parenting," says one mom from Athens, GA. On some 
nights, this is her setup: a 4-year-old, a 7-year-old, and 
one of two parents crammed into the bottom bunk of 
an Ikeabed. One child insists on parental company, and 
her sibling, jealous, slides in for good measure. 

Musical beds are a recurring theme among families 
that reluctantly cosleep, says family therapist Jennifer 
Waldburger, coauthor of The SleepEasy Solution and 
cofounder of the Sleepy Planet consultancy in Los Ange- 
les. She worked with one family that started out nights 
in their own beds, but by dawn, the kids, ages 6 and 9. 
occupied the master bed, with the dad relegated to the 
couch and the mom in the guest room. "It's amazing the 
lengths parents will go to to do what they believe is best 
for their family," Waldburger says. 

But is this the best thing for kids? "I worry about the 
children who know that their parents want them out of 
the bed but can't make it happen," says Jean Kunhardt, a 
family therapist and cofounder of SoHo Parenting, a New 
York City counseling center. "These children have a lot of 
guilt and feel like they're disappointing their parents." 

Kids who crash their parents' beds are also less likely 
to get a good night's rest than their solo-sleeping peers, 
adds Rachel Steinberg, a sleep consultant in Boulder, CO. 
"There's a full interruption in sleep, and it affects the 
quality." Tired kids are at risk for academic issues; pooped 
parents may not perform as well at work. And both fa- 
tigued kids and parents may put on extra weight. 

Therapists worry that kids whose parents can't get them

out of their bed might have other separa- 
tion issues. "I see children not meeting 
age-appropriate expectations, like doing 
homework alone, only to find out in pass- 
ing that the child is cosleeping," says Valerie 
Levine, Ph.D., a psychologist in Hender- 
sonville, NC, and author of Break the Co- 
sleeping Habit. Another milestone that 
may slide: "We aren't teaching these kids 
to self-soothe," says Cora Breuner, Ph.D., 
associate professor of adolescent medicine 
at Seattle Children's Hospital. They may, 
for instance, overly rely on parents to calm 
them when they're upset. And obviously, 
continues Breuner, "they're not learning 
how to fall asleep on their own." 

Sneaking in sex 

And now, the question no one feels com- 
fortable asking a cosleeping parent: What 
about your sex life? Some couples cope by 
having it whenever and wherever. "You 
end up in the living room, not someplace 
you'd ordinarily be," says Mena (the one 
with the black eye). "It's adventurous." The 
Georgia couple who cosleep in a bunk bed 
have sex when the kids are at school, since 
both parents have flexible schedules. 

Michelle Gamble-Risley, a 44-year-old 
publisher from Fair Oaks, CA, says she 
and her husband are so used to their 6-year- 
old daughter showing up at night that it's 
hard to relax when the mood strikes. "It's 
like, Hey, hurry up, she's on her way — we 
can feel it," says Gamble-Risley. 



Beth Abelson Gentle, 42, a stay-at-home 
mom in Oro Valley, AZ, and her husband 
have been woken up in the night so many 
times by their 8-year-old that even when 
he's on a sleepover at a friend's, they've 
stopped out of habit, mid-sex, to lock the 
door. Gentle can now almost laugh at the 
time her son pounded on their door, sob- 
bing, while she and her husband finished 
what they were up to. Afterward, they 
found him fast asleep in the hallway, at 
which point her husband picked him up — 
and brought him into their bed. 

Kunhardt has seen in her therapy 
practice just how tension over cosleeping 
can strain a marriage. "If you can't safe- 
guard your nights and you give yourself 
over to parenting 24/7, how can you pro- 
tect your relationship?" 

Even parents who are happy with their 
family bed often wonder when the time 
is right for their child to move on. Most 
experts agree that kids should be sleep- 
ing on their own by adolescence. "For 
kids entering puberty, cosleeping can be 
uncomfortable, confusing, and even in- 
appropriate," Breuner says. 

Meanwhile, cosleeping parents let it ride 
and savor moments of sweetness. "I love 
how my son sleeps with my hand under his 
cheek," Mena says. Though there are nights 
when she and her husband wish they were 
alone, what's most important is that their 
son feels safe and sound. "He's staying," she 
says, "until he's ready to go." O

-stuff my kids 
■taught me 




Just call us Halloweenies 

Is there a child who doesn't live tor October 31 ? Yes, there are two. Their 
mom, Ellen Seidman, learned that it you can't tace-paint 'em, join 'em. 



My son's first Halloween was scary, for 
both of us. At 10 months old, Max func- 
tioned at a four-month level. A stroke 
at birth had caused brain damage and 
serious delays; doctors weren't sure how 
disabled he would be. Still, I wanted him to have the 
fun-tastic rite of passage everyone enjoys as a kid — the 
thrill of dressing up, the glee of dumping out the night's 
haul. That October, I got Max a ridiculously cute velour 
pumpkin costume and took him to our town's parade. 
Hundreds of kids milled around, store owners doled out 
candy corn, a loudspeaker blasted "Monster Mash." 

Max freaked out. His sensory issues were just begin- 
ning to surface, and the crowd and noise terrified him. 
I felt awful for him, and mournful. We left every other 
family in town at the party and went home. 

1 tried again next year (Max as a puppy) and the year 
after (Max as Thomas the Tank Engine). He wailed; I 
cried. By the time Max's fourth Halloween rolled around 



and he'd been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, I'd given 
up on the parade. My husband took our 2-year-old, 
Sabrina, while Max and 1 carved out our own celebra- 
tion. He put on a fireman's hat, I swung him on our 
backyard swing, and then we downed double-fudge ice 
cream. It was his idea of a good time and, unexpectedly, 
mine too; Sabrina could represent our family amid the 
sugar-fueled swarms. 

But, no. Last year, both kids refused to dress up, 
Sabrina joining Max in a show of sibling solidarity. At 
first I begged her to wear the Ariel getup (S39!!!) I'd 
bought. And then, I let go. We would do Halloween our 
way, in T-shirts and sweatpants. That would be our 
tradition, as quirky as our family itself. 

And so off we went, trick-or-treating. "Who are you?" 
neighbors asked, perplexed by my costume-less chil- 
dren. "I'm Sabrina!" said Sabrina. "Ax!" said Max. Best 
costumes ever. O

How to 

LOVE yoil 

weekday 

mornings 



• The best way to have a calmer 
a.m.? Get a head start the night 
before. "Spend 10 minutes before 
bed making a to-do list of things you 
need to tackle the next day," says 
organizing expert Peter Walsh, author 
of Enough Already! "You'll sleep more 
soundly and, once the alarm goes off, 
be ready for the morning rush." 



Hit the snooze button for the kids. 

A new study finds that teens who get 
a later morning start are less likely to 
be depressed than early risers. Let the 
little ones enjoy more shut-eye too, 
and make a game of gaining back lost 
minutes: Have the kids race to get 
dressed, or time their routine and see 
if they can beat their fastest. 



Take the chill off a crisp morning. 

If your children cling to the covers, 
"Motivate them to get up and dressed 
by warming up their clothes in the 
dryer for a few minutes," Walsh 
suggests. While you're at it, throw in 
your outfit too— or just your undies!

FIVE-MINUTE MONEY MANAGER 

AVOID 
G0TCHAS! 

Happily, the new financial 
reform bill creates a bureau 
to protect us from risky 
mortgages and crazy credit 
card fees. Sadly, most changes 
may not kick in until next year 
or later— and lots of lenders 
are rushing to dupe us while 
they still can. Be sure to... 

• Avoid inflated mortgage 
rates. Some banks reward 
brokers who steer customers 
to higher-rate mortgages, 
which the new law will ban. 
Find a deal at hsh.com. 

• Outmaneuver prepayment 
penalties. Soon, banks won't 

a be able to 
charge extra 
if you payoff 
your mortgage 
ahead of time. 
For now, 
avoid signing 
ones with a 
prepayment 
penalty. 

• Outwit credit card antics. 
Issuers lure you in with a low 
rate, then whack you with a 
higher one for late payments.

retween co-anchoring NBC's The Today Show Saturday

Robach, 37, was already juggling plenty. But she

on after-school programs," Amy says, "since we can't be in

Do Something has allowed the family to survive nanny-free.

PRISTIQ 8 (desvenlafaxine) is a prescription 
medication approved for the treatment of 
major depressive disorder in adults. 
Important Safety Information About PRISTIQ* 



Suicidally and Antidepressant Drugs 
Antidepressants increased the risk 
compared to placebo of suicidal thinking 
and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
teens, and young adults. Depression and 
certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in 
the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who 
are started on antidepressant therapy 
or when the dose is changed should be 
monitored appropriately and observed 
closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, 
or unusual changes in behavior such 
as becoming agitated, irritable, hostile, 
aggressive, impulsive, or restless. Should 
these occur, report them to a doctor. 
PRISTIQ is not approved for use in 
children under 18. 



People taking MAOIs should not take 
PRISTIQ. Tell your healthcare professional 
about all prescription and over-the-counter 
medications you are taking or plan to take, 
including: medicines to treat migraines or 
mood disorders, to avoid a potentially life- 
threatening condition; and aspirin, NSAID 
pain relievers, or blood thinners because 
they may increase the risk of bleeding. 

PRISTIQ may cause or make some conditions 
worse, so tell your healthcare professional 
about all your medical conditions, including: 

• High blood pressure, which should 
be controlled before you start taking 
PRISTIQ and monitored regularly 

• Heart problems, high cholesterol or 
triglyceride levels, or a history of stroke, 
glaucoma or increased eye pressure, 
kidney or liver problems, or have low 
sodium levels in your blood 

• Mania, bipolar disorder, or seizures or 
convulsions 

• If nursing, pregnant, or plan to become 
pregnant 

Discontinuation symptoms may occur 
when stopping or reducing PRlSTIQ, 
so talk to your healthcare professional 
before stopping or changing your dose of 
PRISTIQ. Until you sec how PRISTIQ 
affects you, be careful driving a car or 
operating machinery. Avoid drinking 
alcohol while taking PRISTIQ. Side effects 
when taking PRISTIQ 50 mg may include 
nausea, dizziness, sweating, constipation, 
and decreased appetite.

3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or

In this funky economy, more 
families are saying yes to 
surprising living arrangements, 
The biggest surprise: They're 
loving it, By Julia Litton 



Moving in with your in-laws 
used to be the fodder of 
corny jokes. But it's no 
longer laughable— it's desirable. These 
days, a growing number of families 
are cheerfully sharing homes with 
relatives, friends, and sometimes 
virtual strangers as they outsmart the 
recession. Although no stats exist 
on all alterna-living arrangements, 
the number of multigenerational 
households alone grew by 2.6 million 
between 2007 and 2008, to 49 million. 
"Historically, men would go out and 
work and the wife would move in with 
his family," says Georgia Witkin, Ph.D., 
professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai 
Medical Center in New York City. 
"After World War II, the emphasis 
shifted to the single-family unit. But 
now, people are rethinking things. 
The woman who two years ago would 
never have wanted to live next door to 
a relative is finding that it makes her 
life much easier. The lesson is one 
we knew but had forgotten over the 
years: People, especially during times 
of financial uncertainty, do better in 
groups." For proof, take a tour of these 
four thriving households. 





Four of the six (!ji 
adults in the I 



LIVING WITH (ALL) THE IN-LAWS 

Imagine that you, your husband, and child share a home 
with your mother-in-law, who speaks mostly Urdu. Your 
husbands youngest brother also lives there, along with 
his wife. Oh, and your father-in-law will be moving in 
soon. Okay, now you have a sense of what life is like for 
Bethany Hunter Rasheed, 28. 

Bethany's Pakistani-born husband of seven years, Zee- 
shan, a computer scientist, sees nothing unusual about the arrangement; sharing 
a home with extended family is an ingrained part of his culture. But for Bethany, a 
Southern-bred law graduate, adjusting to rooming with her extended family in a 
four-bedroom house in Herndon, VA, has taken time. "My own family teases me 
that we no longer have guest rooms for them!" she says. "I have to bridge the gap 
daily, but family life is much more interesting than I ever thought it could be." 
One of the best things about having family right there is. . . "All the help at home gives 
us time for hobbies like woodworking, a passion of Zeeshan's, and photography, which 
I love— things wed otherwise never get to. And there's always someone around to wait 
for the cable guy! Most of all, it's incredibly enriching for our 3-year-old son. My moth- 
er-in-law sits with him and holds his hand in hers while she painstakingly traces the 
38 letters of the Urdu alphabet. She tells him stories, fables, and poetry. She cooks things 
he wouldn't usually eat and he actually enjoys even the spiciest of food and the weirdest 
of vegetables. She's even turned me into an accomplished Pakistani cook." 
Savings are built in because... "My sister-in-law, Fouzia, and her husband, Zeeha- 
sham, pay their fair share of the food and household bills. This summer, we pulled

So jiggly. So giggly. So fun!

-UVEMJIIY 



our son out of day care and Fouzia watched 
him; we saved thousands. We treat my 
parents-in-law as guests; they contribute 
in other ways. My mother-in-law would 
be content to cook and clean tor us all 
day. I'm not complaining!" 
I know this sounds like something out of 
a TV sitcom but... "After our wedding, 
my in-laws stayed with us for 52 days. My 
husband lived in a tiny one-bedroom 
apartment, and we all moved in. My in- 
laws got the bedroom, and Zeeshan and 
I got an air mattress on the living room 
floor. That first night, they retired to the 
bedroom but didn't close the door. I was 
like, 'Come on, we're newlyweds!' My 
husband quickly learned to escort them 
to their room— and close the door." 
It still gets a little awkward when... "Try 
fighting with your spouse about why he 
was such a jerk about bringing you an 
extra set of car keys after you locked your- 
self out of the car somewhere— while your 
mother-in-law is sitting on the sofa." 



People would be totally jealous 
if they knew that... "My hus- 
band and I recently left our son 
with the family and took an 
impromptu three-day vacation. 
And we even got a free ride to 
the airport!" 

A WHOLE OTHER KIND 
OF BLENDED FAMILY 

After her di- 
vorce six years 
ago, San Fran- 
cisco mom 
BethMitcham 
found single 
parenthood to 
be lonely work. She adored her boys- 
Alexander and Paulos, then 6 and 4— but, 
"sometimes, when the kids had been play- 
ing me like a piano all day, I would feel 
like I needed to walk away," says Beth, 42 
(above, front row, with her brown-haired 
boys). "There was no one to care for them 




CURRENT RESIDENT OR 

Ms. and Mr. Rasheed 

Mr. and Ms. Rasheed 

Mr.Rahnan 

MS. Shahna? Ehsan 

Herndon, Virginia 2B172 



except me. Also, San Francisco is an ex- 
tremely expensive city, especially when 
you're just one parent." 

Meanwhile, 700 miles away in Renton, 
WA, her sister, Susan Mitcham, 41, a bill- 
ing manager, and brother-in-law, Andy 
Sparks, 42, a planner for an aerospace 
company, were working busy jobs with 
two young kids, Amanda, 4, and Nicky, 
2. "We'd always joked about combining 
forces," says Beth. "When our family would 
visit Susan's and she would take her kids 
out of day care, we'd laugh about how 
awesome it would be if I lived closer and 
could look after them all the time." Says 



PRINCESS THINKS HER STUFF DOESN'T STINK. 






Susan, "Then the lot 
across the street from 
us went on the mar- 
ket, and we realized 
there was no reason 
she couldn't" 

Beth bought the 
lot, had a house built, 
and instantly became an 
at-home mom to four. 

School days start at 6:30 a.m., when 
Beth dashes across the street in her pa- 
jamas ("I don't care who sees me!"), wakes 
her niece and nephew, brings them back 
to her home, feeds all the kids, and drives 
them to school. She also picks them up 
afterward, juggles afternoon activities, 
runs errands for both households, and 
makes dinner for all at her sister's place. 
"The only thing I don't do is clean!" Beth 
says. "When one house gets too messy, I 
head over to the other one. It drives Andy 
crazy, but I hope the happy kids make up 
for the glitter glue." 



Things are relatively calm because... 
"Instead of having a harried single mom 
and two harried full-time workers, we 
can easily handle glitches," Beth explains. 
"Have to work late? No problem, I'm here 
anyway. Kid gets a fever at school? No 
problem, I can go get her. Spent the day 
arguing with my 10-year-old and need 
a break? No problem— I can send him 
across the street." 

The tricky part is... "For me, it can be 
hard balancing howmuch mothering Beth 
does," says Susan. "Like when she's picked 
up Amanda from school because she's 
sick, I've wondered, Do I need to leave 
work and give my daughter TLC, or is it 
okay for Beth do it?" For Beth, keeping 
track of stuff for four kids and three adults 
can be a challenge: "A calendar in the 
pantry doesn't really work when you have 
two pantries." Andy's biggest gripe? "I'm 
out-sistered!" he says, laughing. "Beth 
and Susan sometimes make plans with- 
out me. They once made arrangements 



for all the kids and Beth to visit cousins 
for winter break. Nobody asked me until 
tickets were bought!" 
Financially, this is a no-brainer because. . . 
"Andy and Susan stopped paying $20,000 
a year for child care as soon as I arrived," 
Beth says. "I do fine with the stipend they 
pay me: I can live off it, plus some invest- 
ment income I have, without touching 
my savings." 

It's also a major bonus that... "My boys 
are growing up seeing my sister and her 
husband together," Beth says. "One thing 
I worried about when my husband and I 
split was that my kids would have no 
memory of an 'intact' family. I like that 
the kids have a close-up view of a working, 
happy marriage. Also, it was too easy to 
obsess when I only had two kids to focus 
on. Four kids are about right for me to 
achieve my goal of benign neglect!" 
Awww. .. "More than ever, we're best 
friends," Susan says. "Our whole lives, my 
sister and I have felt like a team," adds

A MODERN-DAY 
COMMUNE FAMILY 

When Jason and 

Devora Kimelman- 

Block were over 

renting apartments 

and ready to set 

down roots, they 

had one goal in 

mind. "My Dad 

grew up in a tightly 
knit neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY," 
says Jason, 38, a rabbi who oversees 
programming for a youth organization. 
"Everyone there looked out for one an- 
other, and we wanted that 
for our own family." 

While they were finish- 
ing grad school and living 
in New York, a friend told 
them about Eastern Vil- 
lage Co-housing in Silver

with some adults," says Devora, 39, who 
runs a meat company. "My oldest daugh- 
ter doesn't want to hang around with 
her mom all the time, but she needs that 
adult female companionship. She's good 
friends with the woman who lives up- 
stairs. Sometimes if she's had a hard 
day, she'll run upstairs at bedtime for a 
visit. She comes back down 20 minutes 
later feeling better." 
We've saved big bucks because. . . "The 
communal spaces make it possible for us 
to live in a smaller apartment," Jason notes. 
"Our children can play in the kids' room 
and do their homework in the study nook. 
We're not confined to four walls." Gener- 
osity abounds: "We have these two big 
closets in the common space— the sharing 
closet and the giving closet," says Devora. 
"The sharing one has things like coolers, 
folding chairs, portable cribs. ..items 
people only use a tew times 
a year and borrow from 
each other. The other 
closet is for things people 
are giving away; it's amaz- 



ing more about it, includ- 
ing its eco-conscious 
design and the group ac- 
tivities (any given week 
might include game night, 
craft night, yoga class, 
and a cooking-club din- 
ner), Jason and Devora were sold. 

The couple have been living there since 
2004 with their four children: Esther, 
11, Natan, 8, Simone, 6, and Micah, 7 
months. They own their unit, one of 56, 
and share a 6,000-square-foot common 
area with a gigantic kitchen and dining 
room where the community typically 
gathers two times a week for meals they 
prepare together. Then there's the com- 
munal playroom, library, exercise room, 
laundry room, and three reservable guest 
bedrooms. "Is it a commune? No!" Jason 
says. "Is it similar to a commune in some 
ways? Yes." 

It's so nice for the kids that... "They

Talk about house parties! 
"During the 'Snowmagge- 
doh blizzard in February 
last year," Jason says, 
"everyone else in the city 
was talking about how bored and iso- 
lated they were. We had a blast!" 
Life can get tense when. . . "Members fail 
to contribute equally in terms of labor 
and involvement," says Jason. "There aren't 
specific labor commitments, so there are 
no penalties— we operate on the trust 
system. Keeping our space clean is an 
ongoing issue. Some are fine takingturns 
cleaning the common areas, others want 
to pay someone to do it. And everyone 
has different standards of cleanliness!" 
The question people always ask us is. . . 
"'Are you good friends with everyone in

TWO SINGLE PARENTS,

Moving in with a guy is never an easy

" I edanewjobin 

■■■^■■■■■B her hunt for a 
place to live with her 10-year-old, Christian, 
she found a beautifully restored, 100-year- 
old Craftsman-style home in a great neigh- 
borhood. But she couldn't afford it. 

Meanwhile Brooke's friend, John Villar- 
real, 37, a divorce with shared custody of 
his 7-year-old, Natassja, was living with 



his parents. The two met for drinks and 
talked about their housing woes. By the 
end of the evening, they'd made plans to 
check out the house together. Three weeks 
later they moved in. Says Brooke, "I feel like 
a poster child for what people can do if they're 
willing to think outside the box." 
They're living large because... "We split 
all our bills equally, which is awesome," 
Brooke says. "What I now pay in rent and 
expenses wouldn't even get me a crappy 
studio apartment in a decent part of town 
if I lived alone." 

It's great to have the company when... 
"... I've had a rough day. I'll text John and 
say, 'It's a wine kind of a night,' and he'll 
join me when he gets home," says Brooke. 
"We have a glass together and talk about 
work or an argument we had with our 
exes. If I get steamed about an issue with 
my son's stepmother, I can ask if he's had 
that issue with his daughter's stepfather. 
We're also each other's romantic advisors. 



When I started dating my boyfriend, John 
was the first person to meet him, and it 
was great to have a man's honest opinion. 
I'm glad he approved!" 
It can get kind of tough when... "... one 
of our kids wants a particular program 
or video game," explains John. "Of course 
I tell my daughter to take turns, but in 
my mind I just want to change the chan- 
nel since my instinct is to make my daugh- 
ter happy. There have been a few head- 
butting moments." 

Just like an old married couple! "Sharing 
one bathroom in the morning is a pain," 
Brooke says. "We have a shower schedule, 
but it can be hard to stick to." Adds John, 
"I thought living together would be a 
breeze, but now I know this relationship 
needs to be cultivated just as much as a 
romantic one. We work to make it work. 
The only difference between us and a 
married couple? After the kids are settled 
in, we retire to our own bedrooms." ©

October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and nationwide 

cuts have left shelters and hotlines badly underfunded. Do just one 

thing on this list and give a woman hope. By Lindsey Palmer 




Brianna

thousands 
just by 
trading 
clothes. 



I lost a clothing-swap fund-raiser, where you pass 
JL a hat to raise funds for domestic violence shelters. 
Identify a needy shelter in your area and register your swap 
(or find one near you) at swapforgood.org. San Francisco 
pals Brianna Cayo Cotter, 29, and Orli Cotel, 31, launched 
Swap for Good in April with no money (friends helped 
design the site). Within months, the nonprofit had raised 
S2,800. Now the swaps are catching on nationwide. 

2 SCOrcil usinggoodsearch.com. Type in "Na- 
tional Domestic Violence Hotline," then surf the 
Internet as you normally would. The site's browser is 
powered by Yahoo; every time you search, GoodSearch 
will donate about a cent to NDVH. With millions of us 
clicking, that's big money! 

3 S/lOp on October 17 at Macy's or on macys.com. 
If you buy a "Shop for a Cause" ticket, your $5 will 
go to the Family Violence Prevention Fund RESPECT! 
campaign, and you'll save 10 to 20 percent on most pur- 
chases, plus 25 percent on one in-store item.

Why you 

should 

take a mini 

break 

Because you can find jaw-dropping deals on 
four-day-weekend trips for fall— and they're a 
lot easier to plan than long vacays. Go for it! 



Travel Off peak. "October and November is 'shoul- 
der season,' the months between high seasons at destina- 
tions," explains Cindy Richards, editor of travelingmom 
.com. That means bargain rates and fewer people. Plenty 
of ski resorts are open now and offer packages featuring 
horseback riding and hiking, while beach resorts in South 
Carolina, Georgia, and Florida have stays at half offhigh- 
season rates. Visit smartertravel.com, orbitz.com, and 
travelzoo.com and search "shoulder season" for deals. 

Send yourself to family camp, imagine 

hiking, campfire-building, and s'mores-eating without 
the mosquitoes, moldy bunks, or bug juice. That's the idea 
behind summer camps that run through fall and are 
typically held in lodges, with heating and good food. To 
find one, go to acacamps.org and click on "Find a Camp," 
or Google "fall family camps" and your state. 




Or jUSt rent a place. "When it's off-season, 
lakeside cabins and beach houses are more likely to rent 
by the night, rather than exclusively by the week, at a 
good price," says Shannon Lane, creator of Traveling 
Mamas.com. Packlate.com specializes in cabins and 
beach homes nationwide. And consider renting with 
friends, adds Lane: "That way, you can share child care 
so each couple has one night off and no one has to pay 
for a babysitter." 

Hit the Water. Plenty of cruise lines — including 
Carnival, Holland America, Celebrity and Disney— offer 
quickie getaways. Bonus: In the fall, a four-day trip can 
often cost the same as a three-day one. And "a lot of lines 
have built-in kid programs, so you have the option of grown- 
up R&R," Richards says. Browse cruisecritic.com/bargains 
/lastminute.cfm or cruises.jetblue.com. —ANNA DAVIES 



The new a mystery r; travel deals 



If you're flexible about 
plans, you can get a 
serious bargain by booking 
through "opaque" travel 
services. Although they 
don't disclose all the 
info until you pay, you're 
guaranteed a big break. 



With Travelocity.com's 

"Top Secret Hotels" feature, 
you'll know the city, price (up 
to a 45-percent discount) 
and star rating of the hotel 
you're booking, but you 
won't know the name until 
you give your credit card. 



Really up for anything? Visit 
familygetaway.com. The 

site is modeled like eBay, 
with people bidding on 
stays. Some locations are 
secret, meaning you might 
not even find out where 
you're going until you pay. 



I 



At 1-800-Hotels-8, you can 
play rate roulette: Just scout 
hotels online, call, and ask for 
the "unpublished rate," then 
commit with a card. At that 
point you'll get a price, 10 to 
25 percent below the lowest 
one offered anywhere else. 



Happy trails! Research suggests much of a vacation's bliss comes from anticipating it, so you may get more out of a few quick trips than a single big one.

On-set scoop 
from Amy Ryan 





In the new movie Jack Goes Boating, 
Ryan (who's back on The Office this 
fall as Steve Carell's ex-girlfriend) is a 
30-something single seeking love. 
She adored working with director 
and costar Philip Seymour Hoffman 
but kept a big secret from him on the 
shoot. Here's how her cover got blown: 

"When we began filming, I was pregnant 
but wanted to keep it to myself until I got 
through my first trimester. My costumes 
were getting tighter by the week, but I still 
didn't say anything— until one day I had 
to wear this party dress [see above]. I put 
it on and immediately ran to the costume 
designer, who is also Philip's girlfriend, in 
a panic, panting, 'You have to let it out. 
But please don't tell Phil. Oh! I can't ask 
you not to tell your boyfriend. But don't 
tell anyone else.' Yep, she was the first 
person besides my fiance to know."

MEDICATION GUIDE BOTOX® 

Read the Medication Guide that comes with BOTOX* 
or BOTOX* Cosmetic beforeyou start using it and 
each time it is given to you. There may be new 
information. This information does not take the 
place of talking with your doctor about your medical 
condition or your treatment You should share this 
information with your family members and caregivers. 

What is the most important information I should 
know about BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic? 

BOTOX® and BOTOX" Cosmetic may cause serious 
side effects that can be life threatening. Call your 
doctor or get medical help right away if you have 
any of these problems after treatment with BOTOX 
or BOTOX 8 Cosmetic: 

• Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing. 
These problems can happen hours to weeks after 
an injection of BOTOX* or BOTOX" Cosmetic 

usually because the muscles that you use to breathe 
and swallow can become weak after the injection. 
Death can happen as a complication if you have 
severe problems with swallowing or breathing after 
treatment with BOTOX* or BOTOX* Cosmetic. 

• People with certain breathing problems may need to 
use muscles in their neck to help them breathe. These 
patients may be at greater risk for serious breathing 
problems with BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmeb'c. 

• Swallowing problems may last for several months. 
People who cannot swallow well may need a 
feeding tube to receive food and water. If swallowing 
problems are severe, food or liquids may go into 
your lungs. People who already have swallowing 

or breathing problems before receiving BOTOX* or 
BOTOX* Cosmetic have the highest risk of getting 
these problems. 

• Spread of toxin effects. In some cases, the effect 
of botulinum toxin may affect areas of the body away 
from the injection site and cause symptoms of a 
serious condition called botulism. The symptoms of 
botulism include: 

• loss of strength and muscle weakness all over the body 

• double vision 

• blurred vision and drooping eyelids 

• hoarseness or change or loss of voice (dysphonia) 

• trouble saying words clearly (dysarthria) 
•loss of bladder control 

• trouble breathing 

• trouble swallowing 

These symptoms can happen hours to weeks after 
you receive an injection of BOTOX ' or 
BOTOX 3 Cosmetic. 

These problems could make ft unsafe for you to drive 
a car or do other dangerous activities. See "What 
should I avoid while receiving BOTOX' or 
BOTOX* Cosmetic?" 

There has not been a confirmed serious case of 
spread of toxin effect away from the injection site 
when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended 
dose to treat severe underarm sweating, 
blepharospasm, or strabismus, or when 
BOTOX® Cosmetic has been used at the 
recommended dose to treat frown lines. 

What are BOTOX' and BOTOX Cosmetic? 
BOTOX* is a prescription medicine that is injected 
into muscles and used: 

• to treat increased muscle stiffness in ebow. wrist and 
finger muscles in adults with upper limb spasticity. 

• to treat the abnormal head position and neck pain 
that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in adults. 

• to treat certain types of eye muscle problems 
(strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids

What Lange keeps in 
her "portable home" 



\ \ 




She was one of the first designers to realize that 
pregnancy meant gaining weight, not losing style. 
Now, with a new non-maternity line of chic everyday 
pieces on HSN, and a blog (shopafrolic.com) where 
she gives supersharp style and shopping advice, 
Lange is gearing up to help you get dressed for the 
rest of your life. Her advice for turning "I have nothing 
to wear!" moments into no-brainers? 

■ Find a formula. "Once I get my two children 
dressed, walk our dog, and make breakfast, I only have 
five minutes left to throw something on. Nine times out 
of 10, it's a sleeveless dress and a long cardigan. My go-to 
is this Searle dress (at right)— I don't care how many 
times I get photographed in it; it just works." 

■ Embrace neutral shoes. "I often dip myself head to 
toe in one color. But I always have gold, nude, or black 

heels on my feet. They go with everything." 
■ Live in your jewelry. "I never take off 
my vintage men's gold Rolex (it was my 
dad's), gold bracelet from the '40s, and big 
citrine ring. Fancy accessories make even 
an outfit from Forever 21 or H&M— both 
of which I love! — look expensive."

Lau 

New show, new movie, 

a new man! The actress, 

who played the cool mom 

we all aspired to be on 

Gilmore Girls, now has a 

star role on Parenthood, 

an indie film, and a real-life 

romance with her costar 

Peter Krause. (So happy for 

her!) She opens up about 

that news for the first 
time with Laurie Sandell. 



In this era of artfully staged paparazzi shots and 
red-carpet arrivals, it's a rare thing for a reporter 
to be invited inside a star's home. For a celeb to have 
you over, actually cook for you, and send you off 
with a gourmet doggie bag? It would be the Holly- 
wood equivalent of triple cherries on the slot machine. 
But that's exactly how Lauren Graham handles our 
interview. "Sorry for the mess!" she says, leading me 
into the kitchen of her airy, suitably gorgeous home 
in Los Angeles (wearing an airy, suitably adorable 
outfit of a white sundress and bare feet). "I'm making a little 
avocado salsa for us," she explains, expertly chopping toma- 
toes. Later, when I mention that I'm heading from her house 
to a friend's barbecue, Lauren insists I take a Tupperware 
container of the dip and some spicy tortilla chips. ("Don't 
forget the chips," she says. "They make the whole thing!") ► 



BOOKS HAVE BEEN A MAIN EVENT for Lauren (here at the 
Hennessey + Ingalls bookstore in Hollywood) since she was a 
child. "There was eating, sleeping— and then there was reading. 
It was the one thing I could do in the day that was totally 
gratifying," she says. "I still have a bunch of my childhood 
books. I don't understand a house that doesn't have books!"

► COVER STORY 





Needless to say, my celebrity salsa is a huge 
hit, and not just because it was prepared 
by TV's favorite school- lunch-maker. 

If Lauren is feeling a bit extra domestic 
these days, there's a reason: After spend- 
ing her 30s so wrapped up in work that 
she back-burnered her romantic life, she 
has finally found love, with her Parenthood 
costar Peter Krause. (Andyes, in avaguely 
awkward twist, Krause plays her brother 
on the show.) Lauren's legions of fans are 
thrilled to see her happily coupled at 
43— and who wouldn't root for her? She's 
as real and relatable as one of your best 
friends, the oneyou just knew had a great 
romance in her future. 

Her excellent news takes on a bit more 
poignancy when you know her childhood 
backstory: The woman who won our hearts 
playing moms wasn't raised by her own 
mother. She grew up in Washington, DC, 
with a single dad; her mother left the fam- 
ily when Lauren was 5, to move to London 
and pursue asinging career. Graham speaks 
lovingly of both parents (her mother died 



five years ago), as wel 1 as her stepmother, 
whom her father married when Lauren 
was in high school. In her book-filled li- 
brary, she shows me a framed black-and- 
white portrait of herself as a baby, being 
held by her maternal grandmother. They're 
watching a beautiful dark-haired woman- 
Lauren's mom— being interviewed on TV. 
"That one's my favorite," she says of the 
picture, smiling. 

When we settle down to do die interview, 
it turns out Lauren is as low-key and 
witty as you'd imagine her to be— with a 
couple more little secrets to reveal, too. 

So on Parenthood, you're playing a 
single mom again. How did you feel 
about that? 

When I was considering Gilniore Girls [at 
age 32], people were like, "You shouldn't play 
a mom. People will think you're too old." 
And I was like, why? People are mothers 
at my age. And when I took Parenthood, 
people said, "You shouldn't play another 
mom."That'slike saying, oh, you're playing

another woman. Mom isn't an adjective 
or a personality; they're not all the same. 

Had you worked with anyone from 
the cast before? 

Peter was one of the first people I met when 
I came out to L.A. [in 1995]. We did an 
episode of Caroline in the City where he 
walked on his hands. 

And now Peter is your boyfriend. 
What's it like to play the sister of 
someone you're dating? 
You can be dismissive and obnoxious to 
them and no one can blame you— but you 
can only get away with that on camera. 
[Luughs.2 You know, one of the things 
that's been so fun [about this relationship] 
is that it's so easy. And it's a lot, to work 
with somebody and then spend time [at 
home] with them too. 

What's the story of how you 
got together? 

As I said, we met when I first came out 
here, but the timing wasn't right. Though 
I think we liked each other. I remember 
one day he asked me over to his house to 
play aboard game— and tiiat's exactiy what 
we ended up doing. So I was like: This guy 
doesn't like me. But I was also like: Who 
actually plays a board game? [Laughs.] 
It's so interesting to me that there was 
clearly a connection there back then, but 
I don't think either of us was ready. 

What was getting in the way? 
You know, he's obviously a very confident, 
appealing guy, but he's shy, and so am I. 
We stayed friends over the years, and I've 
always been a huge fan of his work. 

What are the benefits of meeting 
someone great in your 40s, as opposed 
to your 20s or 30s? 

I've had one, maybe two really good rela- 
tionships that for whatever reason didn't 
work out. I've dated people who I thought 
were going to be a big deal in my life, and 
Fve also spent long periods by myself. While 
I very much wanted to be in a relationship, I 
didn't want to be in the wrong one. 

So you were commitment-phobic? 
Yeah. But I think I've grown up a lot. Now 
I know the difference between my problem

and somebody else's. It's also nice to be 
in this place in my career where the dire 
need to achieve has shifted, because I've 
had the satisfaction of accomplishing some 
of my goals. Not all of them— that will 
never end— but I am proud of the things 
I've done. It takes the edge off work as a 
main focus and allows space for a more 
balanced life. 

What are some of the challenges of 
dating in the spotlight? 
I don't really experience a spotlight. In 
this case, nobody knewfor a while, because 
we like to be at home, cooking and not 
going out. I've also been really protective 
of it, because it's important that you can 
buy us as brother and sister on the show. 



It is interesting that you have so many 
fans, but you dont seem hounded by 
paparazzi. How did you pull that off? 
I have the same friends I've always had; 
most of my dear friends are from college 
[she went to Barnard] or high school. I 
think with a little bit of effort you can lead 
a somewhat quiet life in this business. 
And anyway, I don't know how interesting 
people would find it to have the Gilmore 
girl caught in a brawl. [Laughs^ I'm lying. 
That would be really cool.

A favorite 
photo: a 
baby Lauren 
with her 




grandmother, 
watching 
her mom on 
TV, in 1968. 




The skeptical-mom 
look that started it all: 
on Gilmore Girls with 
Alexis Bledel, 2000. 



Besides Parenthood, you have a new 
movie, It's Kind of a Funny Story. Yet 
you'll probably be asked about Gilmore 
Girls forever. How do you feel about that? 
It wasn't until I did Guys and Dolls [she 
starred in the Broadway show in 2009] and 
met people dairy who came to see me because 
I was on Gilmore Girls that I realized the 
impact it'd had. It was a show people bond- 
ed over. It was a bonding experience for my 
mom and me as well. My mother had lived 
in London since I was little, so she never 
got to see my school plays and stuff. So I 
had the production office send her tapes 
[of the show]. She saw more of me that way, 
and I feel really happy about that. 

So let's talk about your upbringing. Did 
you ever think, I'm being raised by my 
dad and all of my friends have mothers? 
Yeah. In elementary school there would 
be mother-daughter tilings where I wouldn't 
have anyone to bring. It was unusual. But 
my parents were really young [when they 
married]. They knew my dad was in a 
better position [to raise me], and I respect 
that. People make the best choices they 
can, that's honestly how I look at it. 

How did having your father as your 
primary parent shape you as a person? 

He is extremely smart and mellow and 
positive, just an easy person to be with. 
And we had all these adventures: We lived 
on a houseboat in the Virgin Islands for 
half a year, and I went to Europe more than 
any kid I knew. One thing I got from both 
my parents was a sense that it was impor- 
tant to follow something [you're passion- 
ate about] that might not seem practical. 

So how do you envision the next 10 years? 

I would like to be part of a family, how- 
ever that looks. Family is really important 
to me. And 111 probably keep cooking and 
decorating. And working. As an actor you 
have to maximize your time, because you 
don't know what's going to happen in your 
50s and 60s and 70s. It's like the career of 
an athlete: For many people, it ends at a 
certain point. Hopefully 111 live a long time 
and people will be saying, "'How can you 
play another grandmother?!" ©

to style liappiness 

Starting with: Keep it all in the Kidmobile! 




■ Dress on the go. "I always 
have a bag of clothes in the 
car (I call it the Kidmobile) 
so I can change from flip- 
flops for school pick-up 
and drop-off into heels for 

a sexy look if I need to later." 

■ Take accessories seriously 
"I wear tons of jewelry, even 
when I'm in sweats," And she 
doesn't necessarily mean 
diamonds, either: Her current 
favorite item is a $1 5 ring. 

■ Steal from your friends. 

"I love wearing things for the 
first time. And it could be 
borrowed from a girlfriend — 
it just has to be new to me!" 

■ Edit your closet. "I sort all 
of my clothes seasonally, so 
if I need something fast, I can 
grab it from the right section." 

■ Multitask. "I do everything 
at once. Seriously, I'll shave 
my legs and brush my teeth 
while exfoliating my face with 
an acid peel in the shower." 

■ Relax, "For me, mother- 
hood is about letting go of 
the idea of perfection and 
going with the flow." She's 
spreading the word on her 
website, modernmom.com, 
a community for mothers, 
and is writing a memoir, 
The Naked Mom, out in 
February. (Also happening 
for her now? Hosting She's 
Got the Look. Phew!)

WHAT TO ASK FOR: Keratin treatment (also known as KT or 
Brazilian straightening). A mix of proteins and fixatives is 
applied from roots to ends, blown dry, then pressed with a 
flat iron to seal in the solution. "It actually makes your hair 
look and feel healthier," says Alysia Read, owner of UnSprung 
Salon in Portland, OR. "The seal gradually wears off over a 
few months, so there's no telltale line of demarcation," adds 
Rodney Cutler, who owns three salons (one in humid Miami!). 
KT isn't brand-new, but now you have options: make your hair 
pin straight or with a hint of wave that you can easily blow 
out. And the price has gone down, from about $350 to $250. 
HOW TO KEEP IT HEALTHY: Unlike most chemical treatments, 
KT can be used on colored hair. There has been concern over 
the active ingredient, which, when flat-ironed, emits vapors 
that can contain formaldehyde. But chemist Doug Schoon, 
president of Schoon Scientific in Dana Point, CA, who tested 
the air quality in salons doing KT, found formaldehyde levels 
to be within the safe range set by OSHA, the organization that 
regulates workplace safety. His recommendation: Make sure 
your salon is well ventilated. We add: Skip cheap-o treatments 
at hole-in-the-wall spots. Also, avoid shampoo with sodium 
chloride, as it will break down the keratin coating faster. (Try 
Bumble and Bumble Mending Shampoo, S28.)

curls used to take two hours to blow out. Now I have shiny 
hair that I wear wavy or blow superstraight in 15 minutes."

WHAT TO ASK FOR: You can go with KT (see above), but you're 
also the best candidate for Japanese straightening (a.k.a. 
thermal reconditioning, or TR). The advantage of TR — in 
which a relaxing solution is flat-ironed into hair— is that it's 
permanent, and wavy is the one type of hair where it's barely 
noticeable as it grows out. TR will cut your styling time 
(and thus the scorching effects of the blow-dryer) down to 
almost nothing, says New York City salon and spa owner Paul 
Labrecque. 'You can let your hair air-dry, and it'll still come out 
straight as a line." That said, it's very price}', about $400 to $800. 
HOW TO KEEP IT HEALTHY: TR isn't recommended on bleached 
or highlighted hair; chemical overload can lead to breakage, 
Labrecque says. And touch-ups, which can be done on new 
growth only, are tricky— be sure your technician has tons of 
experience. One new trend is to alternate it with KT, so you get 
mega-straightness without quite as much damage. And always 
use moisturizing products (such as Dove Damage Therapy 
Daily Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner, $4.50 each).

WHAT TO ASK FOR: Texturizing, which is a milder, less- 
damaging form of relaxing. It reduces frizz by about 80 
percent so your curls are looser and more defined — and it 
makes it infinitely easier to blow-dry them straight, says 
Dickey (one name, like Madonna), owner of Hair Rules Salon 
in New York City. (Stylist to Nia Long and Natalie Cole, 
he's seen pretty much every curly-hair treatment known to 
man— and he did the hair for this photo shoot.) The newest, 
least-damaging technique, he says, is "selective texturizing, 
in which the texturizer is applied to just the extra-frizzy, 
tough-to-straighten areas around the hairline, the nape of 
the neck, or the crown of the head." Either way, texturizing 
is an investment— but a sound one, because it's permanent. 
Treatments run from $150 to $800, depending on how much 
hair you have and how much of it you straighten. 
HOW TO KEEP IT HEALTHY: If you're making the switch 
from conventional relaxing to texturizing, all traces of your 
previous treatment must be gone (i.e., grown out and cut off) 
or you'll risk serious breakage. And don't re-texturize already- 
treated areas; just touch up your roots. Stay away from 
sulfates in shampoos, which can be too drying. Try Free Your 
Mane Sulfate Free Shampoo, $16.

A year after the Great Mammogram Debate of 2009, 

we're all still confused about when to begin screening for 

breast cancer. REDBOOK went to the best experts 

in the country to help you decide whether to start now, soon, 

or if you might be able to safely wait. 

By Liz Welch Illustrated by Serge Bloch 



For years, women have looked at turning 40 as a milestone 
to be marked with margaritas, maybe a spa trip with 
girlfriends, and, to guarantee another 40 healthy years, 
a first mammogram. That's what doctors and the Amer- 
ican Cancer Society (ACS) recommended, so we complied 
with the annual breast-smooshing tradition. Then, last fall, a 
major switcheroo: A government advisory group recommended 
that women at average risk of breast cancer start mammograms 
at 50. not 40. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 
said the ruling was meant to improve breast care for women. 
What the group actually succeeded at doing was enraging some 
women and doctors, and confusing the rest. 

The backlash from breast cancer advocacy organizations was 
instant and fierce. But what was somewhat overlooked in the 
furor was the task force's final bit of advice: "The decision to 
start regular., .mammography before the age of 50 years should 
be an individual one." As it turned out, the guidelines weren't so 
black-and-white, and the real decision about when to be screened 
had been dumped into the laps of women and their doctors. 

A year later, that's where it remains. In an unofficial but telling 
online poll by the American College of Physicians, 67 percent of 
doctors said they would stop recommending routinemammograms 
to women in their 40s. What's more, radiology centers around the 
country reported that the number of women coming in for tests 
dropped 20 to 25 percent right after the guidelines were released. 
Some experts— like Susan Boolbol, M.D., chief of breast surgery 
at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and Carol Lee, 
M.D., chair of the breast commission of the American College of 
Radiology— believe that in die future we'll see a spike of cancers 
being diagnosed at later, more dangerous stages as a result. 

Are average-risk women who delay screening doing the right 
thing? The task force says yes, that the benefits of earlier mam- 
mography don't outweigh the risks. Specifically, women in their 
40s are more likely to have "false positive" results (meaning a 
mammogram shows an abnormality that turns out not to be 
cancer) than older women, resulting in anxiety, unnecessary 
biopsies, and even overly aggressive treatment of slow-growing 
tumors that may not ever be life-threatening. The task force 
patently denies that the changes were made to cut costs and says 
they were dictated purely by medical evidence. 

Nevertheless, the ACS and the American Congress of Obste- 
tricians and Gynecologists ignored the age change and still say 
routine screening should start at 40. So who's right? There is no 



one-size-fits-all answer. That's why we interviewed 15 of the top 
breast health and radiology experts in the country to find out 
exactly what you should ask— and tell— your M.D. before making 
a decision about mammography. Use this story as a conversation 
guide for your next appointment. 

First ask: What is my 
personal risk for cancer? 

This part of the talk with your doctor will likely be pretty calming: 
The average woman has only about a 12 percent chance of getting 
breast cancer in her lifetime. But some factors raise that risk. If 
any of these apply to you, the wait-until-50 advice doesn't: 

■ Significant family history of the disease. A woman with a 
mom or sister who had breast cancer h as double the average risk 
of getting it herself. (Having male relatives with it, which is rare 
but possible, also raises risk.) "The general rule of thumb is to 
start mammograms 10 years before your youngest affected rela- 
tive was diagnosed," says Marisa Weiss, M.D., founder and pres- 
ident of BreastCancer.org— so if your mom got breast cancer at 
42, you may need to start screening at 32. Other family members 
count too: Having any two close relatives (that includes aunts, 
uncles, and grandparents) with the disease boosts your risk. 

■ Breast cancer genes. About 5 to 10 percent of breast cancer 
cases can be attributed to inherited gene mutations. Someone 
with the BRCAl or BRCA2 mutations, for example, has up to an 
80 percent chance of getting the disease. Women with a strong 
family history may want to talk to a genetic counselor. 

■ Chest radiation before age 30. Receiving radiation treat- 
ments for illnesses like Hodgkin's disease increases breast cancer 
risk. (Having had lots of spine X-rays for scoliosis as a kid may 
affect risk as well, depending on the strength of the radiation.) 

Those are the biggies, but there are other, more minor factors 
that increase a woman's risk. To see how these might affect you, 
go to cancer.gov/bcrisktool. 

Next, weigh the mammo 
pros and cons 

Here's the deal: Mammograms save lives and are still the gold 
standard for early detection of breast cancer. But they're by no 
means a perfect test, says breast surgeon Susan Love, M.D., found- 
er of the Dr. Susan Love Breast Cancer Foundation, especially for 



REDBOOKMAG.COM 211 



premenopausal women, she says. "Younger breast 
tissue tends to be more dense, which makes 
mammograms less accurate; cancer is white, 
and so is breast tissue, SO it's like looking for a 
polar bear in the snow," Love says. Hence, 
the false positive results pointed out in 
the task-force report. One in 69 wom- 
en in their 40s will get breast can- 
cer, but a much higher ratio of 
young women will have a "positive" 
mammogram. Research shows that nine out 
of 10 times, these women don't have cancer, 
says former chair of the task force Diana Pe- 
titti, M.D., professor of biomedical informatics 
at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Still, 
they often have further testing and must deal 
with the anxiety of waiting for results. 

Many women and doctors say they'll ac- 
cept afew weeks of uncertainty if it means 
they're doing all they can to protect them- 
selves. "I had a biopsy in my 40s, and waiting 
to get your results back is stressful," says New 
York City ob/gyn Hilda Hutcherson, M.D. 
"'But in my experience, most women would 
rather go through that than risk missing a 
tumor." Rebecca Rooth, M.D., an ob/gyn 
at Women First in Louisville, KY, agrees: 
"Ninety percent of my patients would say 
it's worth it to make sure you don't have cancer." 

Another possible risk of mammography, however, is radiation 
from the test itself, which some research suggests may slightly in- 
crease breast cancer risk. "One mammogram is not a lot of radia- 
tion," Love says. "But gettingthem every year adds up."The amount 
of risk is hotly debated, but the fact that mammograms expose 
women to some degree of potentially harmful radiation is not. 

Despite the caveats, a majority of ob/gyns and breast specialists 




we talked to said they'd rather women start screenings 
earlier than later. After all, most women who end 
up getting breast cancer are not at obvi- 
ously elevated risk, points out Daniel 
15. Kopans, M.D., professor of ra- 
diology at Harvard Medical 
School. This doesn't mean 
doctors won't discuss the 
option of waiting: "One 
patient recently wanted to 
postpone mammography until 
she tu rned 50," says New York City 
ob/gyn Adelaide Nardone, M.D. "She 
was low-risk and insistent about wait- 
ing, so after a thorough medical his- 
tory and risk assessment, I respected 
her decision." To be careful, says Nardone, 
I ask my patients like these to at least con- 
sider getting a baseline mammogram in 
their 40s to establish the normalcy and den- 
sity of their breasts." In the end, if you're at 
low risk, the choice of when to start routine 
mammograms is up to you, Petitti says. It largely 
depends on what's more important to you right now: Reducing 
an xiety and the potential risks of unnecessary testing, or pos- 
sibly catching an early-stage cancer. "If you have a mammogram, 
there's a chance you're going to need a biopsy that will turn 
out to be absolutely nothing," says Lee. "But there's also a 
chance that you'll have a cancer picked up and might have your 
life saved. You have to weigh that and decide." 

Finally, take some simple 
steps to stay safe 

Whenever you choose to begin mammography, prevention can 
start now. Being overweight increases breast cancer risk— while 



Your breasts: a picture show 

Mammography is proven to save lives and is still the gold standard in early detection. But 
make pinpointing cancers more difficult. Thankfully, it's not the only tool in our screening 




TRADITIONAL FILM SCREEN 
MAMMOGRAPHY 

An X-ray beam is used to create a photograph 

of the breast on film. The results are most 

accurate in women over 50, according to the 

National Cancer Institute (NCI). 




DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY 

The same as traditional mammography, 
except the image is digital and may be slightly 

better at picking up cancers in younger 

women, per the NCI. More than half of all U.S. 

mammogram machines are digital now— if 

you're under 50, press for a digital test. 




ULTRASOUND 

Just like ultrasounds during pregnancy, sonic 
waves are used to create a picture. Ultrasound 

is good at distinguishing cysts from solid 

masses, and is sometimes used in addition to 

mammography to investigate lumps before 

moving on to a biopsy.

being physically active for as little as 10 to 20 minutes a day low- 
ers it. Watching alcohol intake is also important, as is simply 
being aware of how your breasts normally look and feel. The ACS 
and other major medical groups no longer advocate formal breast 
self-exams, but every health expert we spoke to was adamant 
that women should explore once in a while, in the shower, getting 
dressed, whenever. If you notice something strange— a lump, 
puckering, skin discoloration, or even scabbing— get to an M.D. 
One last bit of advice for women who want to stay well, this one 
from breast cancer survivor Lauren E. Miller, author of the book 
Release the Stress around Breast Cancer: Don't let fear of breast 
cancer make health-care decisions for you. "I've been in touch with 
hundreds of women who've avoided screening of any kind because 
they were afraid," she says. "I know people who won't even touch 
their body because, 'Oh, my God, what if I find a lump?'" Of course, 
when found early, breast cancer is highly treatable — so fear, and 
the delay in diagnosis it may cause, could turn out to be a bigger 
killer than rogue cells growing in your body. "Are we going to 
wony, and be stuck in doubt, telling ourselves, 'I'm not going to 
be okay'? Or are we going to be empowered and take our health 
into our own hands?" Miller asks. You know a lot more than you 
did when you picked up this article 10 m inutes ago. Talk it through 
with your doctor and you will make the right choice. © 

GOOD SCREENING NEWS 

Free mammograms! 

When you decide to begin routine mammography, there's a 
chance your tests could be free— no co-pays, no deductibles, 
nothing. "We want to be proactive about keeping women 
healthy by catching breast cancer early," says Stephanie Cutter, 
who is assistant for special projects to President Obama. 
That's why one provision of the recently instated health care 
reform act requires insurance companies to eliminate co-pays 
and other fees for mammograms, beginning this fall. For now, 
only women who sign up for new health plans (or whose plans 
change significantly) are eligible, but starting in 2014, the rules 
will apply to most insured women, says Cutter. For more details, 
search "mammograms" at healthcare.gov. 



"My problematic pair" 



I Vetch, yon < mild be injur lots of 
biopsies and worry. There is a better 
way, and she explains it here. 

At 41 years old, I've already had not one, not two, but 
three mammograms. A few false negatives and biopsies 
too. I have cystic breasts, which is as unsexy as it 
sounds. The good news is, they do not put me at higher 
risk for breast cancer. 

That said, they cause me lots of lump scares, which 
result in more mammograms and agita. I felt my first lump 
at 35, as did my ob/gyn, who sent me for a diagnostic 
mammogram to figure out what it was. I have no family 
breast cancer history, so I was quite calm— until the 
radiologist spotted a pea-size "dense spot" and 
recommended a biopsy. A surgeon marked an X on my 
breast with a Sharpie, injected anesthesia, and then placed 
a retracting needle attached to a dart -gun-like contraption 
on it. I heard a pop and felt a dull tug. "Whoops," he said. "I 
missed." He tried again— pop, tug, tug— and said, "Bingo." 

First came the pain, then the nausea and fear while I 
waited several days for the results: benign. When I felt a 
new lump 18 months later, the same scenario ensued: 
mammogram, biopsy, worry, benign diagnosis, relief. 
Then frustration. Was I going to have to go through this 
every couple years for the rest of my life? 

Thankfully, my ob/gyn had a plan. I should have a 
baseline ultrasound to identify pre-existing cysts (see 
"Your Breasts: A Picture Show," below) and then repeat 
ultrasounds yearly to track any new ones. That first ultra- 
sound showed an unidentifiable lentil-size mass, and my 
new breast specialist sent me for what would be my third 
mammogram. That time, the radiologist decided that, 
based on my history, it was probably just a cyst. 

My breasts will always be lumpy, but thanks to my 
ob/gyn and a great specialist, I now have a protection 
plan that doesn't involve constant needle punctures. My 
advice to other women like me? Partner with your doctor 
to come up with a strategy, and become your own expert. 
No one should know your breasts better than you. 



experts admit it's far from perfect— especially for premenopausal women, whose denser breasts 
arsenal. Here's a look at what's out there now, and some exciting options still on the horizon. 




MRI (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING) 

Magnet and radio waves are used to create 
a computer image of the breast. MRIs are 

more sensitive than mammograms or 

ultrasounds, but they're very expensive. 

They are often used to see lumps that didn't 

show up on other tests. 




DIGITAL TOMOSYNTHESIS (ALSO 
KNOWN AS 3-D MAMMOGRAPHY) 

This tool provides a 3D digital image and has 

been found to reduce the number of false 

positive results compared with traditional or 

digital mammography. It's available in Europe 

but not yet in the United States.

imaging, which uses a dye injected into the 
breast, and a "breast Pap," which looks for 

abnormal cells in breast fluid. To join a

love that you're... mine 

Dear Laura, 

From the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew that if I played 
my cards right, you could become the greatest catch of my life. 
During the off-season, I would lie on my couch with the 
phone on my belly, waiting for you to call. My friends thought 
I was out of my mind; they'd never seen me act this way over 
a woman. But you were the girl who had it all: brains, beauty, 
and a heart of gold. Plus I got a tremendous kick out of you— you 
made me laugh. After 10 years of marriage and two children, 
even now, when you come to my games, I hit the ball extra hard.

I love your laugh 

Dear Sara, 

Your laugh can reach out and get 
me from two floors away, from the 
far side of a cocktail party, from the 
next room where you're watching 
Top Chef. It's rich, rolling, high- 
pitched— mischievous yet warm— 
a laugh that closes gaps between 
people. You're easy to like for a 
number of reasons— your kindly 
personality, your lightning wit— but 
it's your laugh that has this Velcro 
effect. And you are generous with 
it. On many an occasion, when 
I dozed on a bright morning at a 
summer house we were sharing 
with friends, your laughter from the 
vicinity of the coffee pot brought 
me to fuzzy consciousness. 
Even as I lay in semi-sleep, those 
French-roasted giggles made me 
alert, curious, and finally jealous: 
I needed to be there to receive my 
full share of the hilarity, and bask in 
the glow of being married to such 
a life-loving vixen. Betty Rubble, 
your laugh is pretty cute. But you've 
got nothing on my wife.

I love your secret 
inner seductress 

Dear Dirty Little Dominatrix 
Who Lives Inside My Wife, 
I love you. I mean— I really, really love you. 
Oh, sure, I love that other woman too. You 
know, my wife, the one whose subconscious 
you hide out in for days, biding your time. 
That woman is astonishing in many ways: 
She's the tireless mother of my 4-year-old 
son. She's an emotional boulder. She's 
hilarious and brilliant, and she cooks a 
life-affirming chicken marsala. 

But what you and I have is different. 
Sure, we don't get to see each other as 
much as we did back in our 20s, when 
you'd come out to play at the drop of 
a spaghetti strap. There's good reason: 
By the time my wife and I wrestle the 
kid to sleep, it's a miracle if we're still 
sentient. Still, on those nights when we 
put aside the remote and we start looking 
at each other— really looking at each other 
again— you will emerge, slowly. Then there 
you are. I can tell it's you, because your 
eyes get narrow and you claw at my arms 
and say wonderfully dirty things— things 
the nice woman who picks our son up at 
preschool shouldn't even know how to say. 

And I smile and think, Welcome back.

were living in a hotel, so I didn't know you had so 
much skill in the kitchen. Then we moved into our house, 

and that first time you made me a pasta dinner, 

watched you in action in your red Louboutin heels. Dinner 

was delicious and ready in minutes! They say, 

"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." 

I got lucky with you. 

Yours, Lamar 

Lamar Odom, forward for the Los Angeles Lakers 
and husband of Khloe Kardashian 



I love your 
optimism 

Carole, 

You have a way of 

transforming the negative 

into the positive. In 

the last two days, I 

demolished the garage door 

and broke the computer— 

and you reminded me that 

they were only material things. 

When I'm about to crack, 
you take me to dinner and we 

talk about other stuff. 

I've been passionately in love 

with you for 12 years, and it's 

just the beginning. 

LOVE, GILLES 
Gilles Marini, actor, Brothers & Sisters 

I love your very bad 
housekeeping 

O, Annabelle... 

Why am I charmed by the way you rip 
open cartons of cereal, packages of 
deli meats, and bags of potato chips 
like you are a feral, starving animal? 
Whenever I see those slashed, leaking, 
torn-asunder containers, I gush with 
amorous affection. And I'd love for 
some scientist to explain how you can 
jam your laundry into the washer like 
you're stuffing a holiday turkey, let your 
clothes sit in the dryer for days before 
pulling them out all stuck together, and 
then shove them unfolded into your 
dresser— and yet the moment you put 
them on, they look amazing! You go out 
all professional and pressed, but I get to 
see the genuine you, the raw, wild, sexy 
Annabelle; my undomesticated bride.

Yes, this does 

count as a love 

note from your 

husband! 



I love your 
no-BSpolicij 

My Darling, 

Do you remember yesterday, 
Saturday, the early afternoon? The 
kids were destroying our apartment 
with Sharpies and a Phillips-head 
screwdriver, and I was on the sofa 
in a half-doze, pretending to be 
monitoring them, while you replied 
to an urgent email from your family? 
Well, at that moment I started to 
think about how busy we always are, 
with our kids, our work, and replying 
to urgent emails. Time never slows 
down enough, I thought, for me to 
tell you all the reasons I love you, 
how there is no one else Id rather 
talk to, eat with, raise vandals with. 
But if I had to pick the one thing 
I love most, it might be that you 
tell it to me straight. We don't act 
"romantic," or fetishize each other "s 
domestic habits. We call it like we 
see it. When I say, for example, "Back 
off, I do inspect the berries before I 
buy them," and you regard me with 
that wicked beam in your brown eyes 
and say, "Nice try, freak show," more 
love has passed between us than in a 
thousand lousy sonnets. 

Love, ME

love your wisdom 



Dear Lisa, 

On the sunny lawn of your parents' home exactly 25 years ago, I made the 
smartest decision of my life and married you. True, we have pushed every 
button in our psyches, which might explain why you stomped on my wedding 
tux (before I donned the outfit) but still walked down the aisle with me. 

Since then, you've taught me that adults never really grow up; rather, we learn 
how to act in public and hide the deeper emotions that underlie the actions 
we choose. Over the course of our marriage, you've learned that, like most 
men, I best understand simple concepts expressed directly, especially when 
written— which may explain the lists you frequently leave on my desk. Perhaps 
out of desperation, you finally broke down and outlined your lessons for me in 
your book, Us. You compiled a quarter century of pillow talk (offered as sleep 
descended on my cardiac surgery-focused brain) in order to teach me and 
others that we best achieve personal growth through relationships. 

Whenever you are happy, I celebrate. Wherever you are, there is my Eden. 
Love forever, M EH MET

I love your 
secret messages 

Mellie, 

I love our silent lingo. 

We can have a whole 

"conversation" undetected 

in a group, solely through 

meaningful glances and 

subtle expressions. After 

18 years, you can still knock 

me out with a look.

Some pound cake, some frosting, and it's a wrap! 

Total time: 2 hours (includes chilling) 



1. Using the photo as a guide, cut the 
1-lb frozen pound cake into a coffin 
shape by cutting off diagonal slices from 
each corner. Starting 'k inch in from the 
edges of cake, using a small paring knife, 
carefully cut out a 2-inch-deep hollow in 
the middle of the cake, leaving a '/2-inch 
wall of cake around the edges of the 
coffin. Place on a serving plate. 

2. Spoon chocolate frosting into a large, 
microwave-safe bowl; tint frosting black 
with food coloring. Microwave on high 
10 to 15 seconds, stirring once, just until 
frosting reaches a thin glaze consistency. 
Carefully spread glaze over coffin cake 
to cover the sides and inside the hollow 
in a thin, even layer. Refrigerate to 
harden glaze. 

3. With paring knife, carve the second, 
smaller pound cake into a mummy shape 



that will fit inside the hollow of the coffin 
cake. Place mummy cake on a wire rack 
set over waxed paper. Spoon half of the 
vanilla frosting into a microwave-safe bowl; 
microwave on high 10 to 15 seconds, until 
pourable. Pour glaze over mummy cake to 
cover, and refrigerate to harden glaze. 

4. Place i imalning vanilla frosting into a 
disposable pastry bag fitted with a flat tip. 
Pipe frosting "bandages" over mummy 
cake, as shown in photo. Refrigerate to 
harden frosting. 

5. Spread raspberry jam in hollow of 
coffin cake. Carefully place mummy cake 
on top of the jam layer. 

6. Mound chocolate cookie crumbs 
around base of cake on serving plate. 
Decorate with candy-bone sprinkles, toy 
insects, and whatever else spooks you!

OCTOBER'S 
SUPERFOOD: 
RED GRAPES! 

Nothing like a healthy snack that doesn't need to 
be unwrapped, cut up, or otherwise fussed with. 
All grapes have only 100 calories per cup and 
provide fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. But red 
and purple grapes may have a bit of an edge: 
the nutrient anthocyanin, which research shows 
may have cancer-fighting properties. And because 
domestic grapes— in season this month— often have 
lower levels of pesticide residues, you don't even 
need to splurge for organic, says dietician Jackie 
Newgent, R.D., author of Big Green Cookbook. 
(Don't worry about that white powdery stuff you 
sometimes see; it's usually just natural fermentation.) 
Toss grape halves with goat cheese and pistachios 
into a salad, chop and stir into couscous, or freeze 
'em for a sweet treat. — nicoleyorio 



A simple DIET TWEAK that slashes 
your risk of diabetes 

Swapping white rice out for brown could reduce your chances 
of developing type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, according to new 
research from the Harvard School of Public Health in Cambridge, 
MA. Experts want all of us to make the switch, because rates of 
type 2 diabetes— which is a top cause of heart problems— have nearly 
doubled among women in the last three decades. But don't stop at 
brown rice: Eating other whole grains such as barley or wheat every 
day may cut your risk by a whopping 36 percent, the study found. 
Try tabbouleh, a Mediterranean bulgur-wheat salad made with 
tomatoes and cucumber. Whip up an instant version and 
just add a little feta cheese. Yum! —laurel leicht

It's not the fake fangs, spiders, or haunted houses that scare my friends most this 
time of year. Oh, no— it's the pillowcases full of chocolate and candy corn! My advice: 
Never stock your house with your absolute favorite candy (you know who'll eat most 
of it), and keep this in mind when snagging a piece from your kid's trick-or-treat bag:

our house in San Antonio, I had my stove built into the island so I can 
face out when I'm cooking, as opposed to having my back to everybody. 

My worst habit in the kitchen is not allowing anybody to help 
me. I like to cook by myself. Tony calls me "the crazy woman" at 
Thanksgiving. He says, "Don't get near her; she's in her crazy mode." 
I always host Thanksgiving at our house. We typically have about 
20 to 25 people, family and friends, including all of the "homeless" 
basketball players on Tony's team who live too far away to go home 
for the holiday. I deep-fry our turkey. It's juicier than roasting it. 

My signature dishes are ropa vieja [a Caribbean shredded- 
beef dish] and tortilla soup. I found the tortilla-soup recipe in a 
magazine when I was 14. It might have been REDBOOK! 

Home cooks should spend more time prepping so they spend 
less time cooking. I do all of my chopping in advance so that when 
I'm ready to cook, everything is waiting for me. 

Baking is too precise for me. I cook with a pinch of this or that. 

I could never give up Mexican food. Nachos are usually my go-to 
if I'm courtside at an NBA game. I always, always get my picture 
taken with my mouth wide open and atortilla chip sticking out of it!

chiles in my tortilla soup."*

Losing Weight 
But Can't Get Rid of 

Belly 
Bulge? 



Getting rid of stubborn belly fat can take more than diet and 



Y r ou diet... you exercise... you're even losing weight. But 
take a look in the mirror... you still have that unsightly 
belly bulge. Twenty pounds lighter and you still look... 
well... fat! How in the world can that be possible? 

Stress. That's right... stress! As it 
turns out, the same diet that's helping 
you lose weight might actually be 
causing you to retain figure-destroying 
belly fat. That's because dieting is 
stressful. You worry about what to eat- 
when to eat... how much to eat. All that 
worry leads to "diet stress." 

And, as we all know by now, even 
ordinary, everyday stress can cause your 
body to increase or retain belly fat. That's 
why you can go on a diet, lose weight, but 
still look thick around the middle. 

So what are we to do? Millions of 
women are turning to weight-control "ad- 
juncts" or "add-ons." These groundbreak- 
ing compounds are not really diet pills in 
the true sense of the word. Instead, they 
help traditional diet and exercise programs 
reduce tummy bulge by controlling diet- 
related stress and anxiety... the same stress 
and anxiety that can lead to stubborn belly 




a ■ Excess tummy flab may not be your 

fault: That's the startling conclusion 

reached by scientists who discovered 

the likely cause of stubborn belly fat. 3 " 

fat retention (not to mention that all-time 
diet killer "Nervous Binge Eating"). 

Over the past five years, the 

most popular "Belly Fat" pill has been 
Relacore" (from the Carter-Reed 
Company ,u ). Relacore has sold more than 
12.7 million bottles worldwide and is 
affectionately called "America's #1 Selling 



Your satisfaction is 1009! guaranteed. If, for any reason, you are not totally satisfied with the 
power of Relacore. simply return the empty container within 30 days for a full, prompt, no-questions- 
asked refund! 



'Belly Fat' Pill." Relacore has a great track 
record... and it wouldn't be America's #1 
selling "Belly Fat" pill five years running if 
people didn't love it. 

Let's face it, you not only want to lose 
weight, you want to look good... and 
looking good means a thinner waist and 
flatter tummy. 

So if you're ready to go on a diet, or if 
you're already losing weight and having 
a hard time getting rid of your stubborn, 
stress-related belly bulge, try this 
exceptional tummy-flattening, feel good 
pill. America's most popular weight-control 
"adjunct," Relacore. 

As they say in all the ads... 
"Its easy... you'll love it."
